# Curriculum Mapping Prompt: Informatics for Mexico

You are an expert curriculum analyst specializing in Mexico's official national education standards for Informatics.

Your task is to create a comprehensive, hierarchical JSON structure that maps the complete Informatics curriculum for grades 9-12 according to Mexico's official government education standards: **Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum**.

---

## 1. Research and Accuracy Requirements

**Authoritative Sources:**
- Base your structure on the official Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) curriculum documents
- Follow the **Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum** standards and framework
- Ensure accuracy to Mexico's actual teaching practices and pedagogical approaches
- Use terminology and concepts standard in Mexico's education system

**Grade Level Context:**
- Grade 9-10: Educación Media Superior - Primero y Segundo Semestre
- Grade 11-12: Educación Media Superior - Tercero y Cuarto Semestre

---

## 2. JSON Structure Format

Follow this **exact** hierarchical structure:

```json
{
  "grade_9_10": [
    {
      "key": "unique_topic_key",
      "name": "Topic Name in Spanish",
      "short_description": "Brief description of the topic scope and key learning goals (1-2 sentences)",
      "sub_topics": [
        {
          "key": "unique_subtopic_key",
          "name": "Subtopic Name in Spanish",
          "short_description": "Brief description of what students will learn in this subtopic",
          "sub_topics": [
            {
              "key": "unique_sub_subtopic_key",
              "name": "Detailed Concept Name in Spanish",
              "short_description": "Specific learning objective or skill to be mastered",
              "example_tasks": [
                "Example task 1 that demonstrates this concept (age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned)",
                "Example task 2 with slightly different approach or difficulty",
                "Example task 3 showing practical application or real-world connection"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "grade_11_12": [
    // Same hierarchical structure as grade_9_10
  ]
}
```

## 3. Depth and Coverage Requirements

**Breadth (Horizontal Coverage):**
- **Grade 9-10**: Include 8-12 main topics that cover the full curriculum for these grades
- **Grade 11-12**: Include 8-12 main topics that cover the full curriculum for these grades
- Total main topics across both grade levels: 16-24

**Depth (Vertical Hierarchy):**
- **Level 1 (Main Topics)**: 8-12 per grade level
- **Level 2 (Sub Topics)**: 3-6 per main topic
- **Level 3 (Detailed Sub Topics)**: 2-5 per sub topic
- **Level 4 (Example Tasks)**: 3-5 tasks per detailed sub topic

**Total Size Target:**
- **3,000-3,500 lines** of JSON
- **150,000-160,000 characters** in total
- This ensures comprehensive coverage of the entire 4-year secondary curriculum

---

## 4. Content Quality Standards

### Language and Terminology:
- **All names and descriptions MUST be in Spanish**
- Use official terminology from Mexico's education system
- Keys should be in lowercase_with_underscores (English or transliterated)
- Be consistent with naming conventions throughout

### Short Descriptions:
- Keep to 1-2 sentences (concise but informative)
- Focus on learning objectives and key concepts
- Use pedagogically accurate language
- Align with official curriculum language and goals

### Example Tasks:
Each example task must be:
- **Authentic**: Reflect the types of assessments and exercises used in Mexico
- **Age-appropriate**: Suitable for the cognitive level of the grade
- **Progressive**: Show increasing complexity across the 3-5 examples
- **Curriculum-aligned**: Match the learning objectives of the official curriculum
- **Practical**: Where possible, connect to real-world contexts relevant to Mexico
- **Diverse**: Cover different cognitive levels (recall, application, analysis, synthesis)
- **Clear**: Fully specified so a student or teacher understands what is being asked

### Progression:
- Ensure logical progression from Grade 9-10 to Grade 11-12
- Build on prerequisite knowledge appropriately
- Increase complexity and abstraction in later grades
- Reflect the actual sequencing in Mexico's curriculum

---


### Subject-Specific Requirements for Informatics:

**Core Topics to Include:**
- Programming Fundamentals (Python, JavaScript, control structures, data structures)
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frontend and backend development)
- Computer Systems (hardware, operating systems, networks, software)

**Pedagogical Considerations:**
- Balance theoretical concepts with hands-on practical projects
- Include real-world applications and industry-relevant skills
- Progress from visual/block-based programming to text-based coding
- Emphasize problem-solving and computational thinking
- Include ethical considerations and responsible technology use

## 5. Curriculum Alignment Checklist

Before and during your work, ensure:
- [ ] You have researched the official Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum
- [ ] All main topics reflect mandatory content in the curriculum
- [ ] Topic sequence matches the typical teaching order in Mexico
- [ ] Time allocation and emphasis match curriculum priorities
- [ ] Assessment types in example tasks reflect Mexico's evaluation methods
- [ ] Cultural context is appropriate (examples, references, applications)
- [ ] Language is natural and authentic for Spanish

## 6. Delivery Format (In Chunks)

Since this is a large dataset (~3000-3500 lines), deliver it in manageable chunks.

### Step 1: Overview
First, provide a **complete overview** listing:
1. All main topics for grade_9_10 (with brief 1-sentence descriptions)
2. All main topics for grade_11_12 (with brief 1-sentence descriptions)
3. Confirmation that this structure aligns with Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum
4. Estimated line count and character count for the full output

**Wait for approval before proceeding to chunks.**

### Step 2: Deliver Chunks
After approval, deliver the full JSON data in chunks as follows:

**Chunk 1**: `grade_9_10` array - First 2-3 main topics (complete with all sub_topics, sub_sub_topics, and example_tasks)

**Chunk 2**: `grade_9_10` array - Next 2-3 main topics

**Chunk 3**: `grade_9_10` array - Next 2-3 main topics

**Chunk 4**: `grade_9_10` array - Remaining main topics

**Chunk 5**: `grade_11_12` array - First 2-3 main topics

**Chunk 6**: `grade_11_12` array - Next 2-3 main topics

**Chunk 7**: `grade_11_12` array - Next 2-3 main topics

**Chunk 8**: `grade_11_12` array - Remaining main topics

**IMPORTANT**: The `grade_9_10` and `grade_11_12` keys should contain **arrays** directly, NOT objects with a "topics" key. The structure should be:
```json
{
  "grade_9_10": [ /* array of topics */ ],
  "grade_11_12": [ /* array of topics */ ]
}
```

### Chunk Completion Format:
After each chunk, state:

```
✅ Chunk [X] of [TOTAL] complete.
📊 Character count for this chunk: [XXXXX]
📈 Cumulative character count: [XXXXXX] / ~160,000
🔄 Ready for next chunk? Reply 'continue' to proceed to Chunk [X+1].
```

---

## 7. Final Validation

After delivering all chunks, provide:
1. **Total line count**
2. **Total character count**
3. **Confirmation** that all main topics from the overview are included
4. **Self-check** that content aligns with Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum

---

## 8. Important Notes

- **DO NOT hallucinate or invent curriculum content.** If you are unsure about specific topics in Mexico's curriculum, indicate this and use general best practices for the subject.
- **Prioritize accuracy over creativity.** This data will be used for educational purposes.
- **Be consistent** with JSON formatting, key naming, and structure throughout all chunks.
- **All content must be in Spanish** except for keys.
