# Curriculum Mapping Prompt: Literature for Mexico (Grade 3-6 (Primaria))

You are an expert curriculum analyst specializing in Mexico's official national education standards for Literature.

Your task is to create a comprehensive, hierarchical JSON structure that maps the complete Literature curriculum for Grade 3-6 (Primaria) (3-6, ages 9-12) according to Mexico's official government education standards: Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum.

---

## 1. Research and Accuracy Requirements

Authoritative Sources:
- Base your structure on the official Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) curriculum documents
- Follow the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) Curriculum standards and framework
- Ensure accuracy to Mexico's actual teaching practices and pedagogical approaches
- Use terminology and concepts standard in Mexico's education system

Grade Level Context:
- Grade Range: 3-6
- Local Label: Primaria (3-6)
- Age Range: 9-12
- Teacher Role: Maestro de Primaria

---

## 2. JSON Structure Format

Follow this exact hierarchical structure (start directly with an array):

```json
[
  {
    "key": "unique_topic_key",
    "name": "Topic Name in Spanish",
    "short_description": "Brief description of the topic scope and key learning goals (1-2 sentences)",
    "sub_topics": [
      {
        "key": "unique_subtopic_key",
        "name": "Subtopic Name in Spanish",
        "short_description": "Brief description of what students will learn in this subtopic",
        "sub_topics": [
          {
            "key": "unique_sub_subtopic_key",
            "name": "Detailed Concept Name in Spanish",
            "short_description": "Specific learning objective or skill to be mastered",
            "example_tasks": [
              "Example task 1 that demonstrates this concept (age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned)",
              "Example task 2 with slightly different approach or difficulty",
              "Example task 3 showing practical application or real-world connection"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY the JSON array. Do NOT wrap it in an object with a "grade_3_6" key.

## 3. Depth and Coverage Requirements

Breadth (Horizontal Coverage):
- Include 10-30 main topics to ensure COMPLETE coverage of the curriculum for Grade 3-6 (Primaria)
- Cover ALL mandatory content areas from the official curriculum
- Better to have more topics with good coverage than fewer topics with gaps

Depth (Vertical Hierarchy):
- Level 1 (Main Topics): 10-30 topics (adapt based on subject complexity and curriculum breadth)
- Level 2 (Sub Topics): 3-6 per main topic
- Level 3 (Sub Topics with example Tasks): 3-5 tasks per detailed sub topic

Total Size Target:
- Minimum 1000-1500 lines of JSON for this grade level
- Minimum 60,000-100,000 characters
- This ensures comprehensive coverage of the curriculum for 3-6

**Priority**: Completeness over size constraints. If the curriculum requires 25 main topics to be fully covered, include all 25.

## 4. Content Quality Standards

### Language and Terminology:
- All names and descriptions MUST be in Spanish
- Use official terminology from Mexico's education system
- Keys should be in lowercase_with_underscores (English or transliterated)
- Be consistent with naming conventions throughout

### Short Descriptions:
- Keep to 1-2 sentences (concise but informative)
- Focus on learning objectives and key concepts
- Use pedagogically accurate language
- Align with official curriculum language and goals

### Example Tasks:
Each example task must be:
- Authentic: Reflect the types of assessments and exercises used in Mexico
- Age-appropriate: Suitable for ages 9-12
- Progressive: Show increasing complexity across the 3-5 examples
- Curriculum-aligned: Match the learning objectives of the official curriculum
- Practical: Where possible, connect to real-world contexts relevant to Mexico
- Diverse: Cover different cognitive levels (recall, application, analysis, synthesis)
- Clear: Fully specified so a student or teacher understands what is being asked

## 5. Curriculum Alignment Checklist

## 6. Delivery Format - CHUNKED APPROACH

**IMPORTANT**: Deliver the curriculum in **5 CHUNKS** to ensure comprehensive coverage and better organization.

### Before Starting: Create a Complete Plan

Before generating any JSON, provide a detailed plan that divides the curriculum into 5 chunks:

```markdown
# Curriculum Plan for Literature - Mexico (Grade 3-6 (Primaria))

## Chunk 1 (Topics 1-X): [Thematic Group Name]
Main topics to include:
- Topic 1: [Topic name and brief scope]
- Topic 2: [Topic name and brief scope]
- ...

## Chunk 2 (Topics X-Y): [Thematic Group Name]
Main topics to include:
- Topic X: [Topic name and brief scope]
- ...

## Chunk 3 (Topics Y-Z): [Thematic Group Name]
Main topics to include:
- Topic Y: [Topic name and brief scope]
- ...

## Chunk 4 (Topics Z-W): [Thematic Group Name]
Main topics to include:
- Topic Z: [Topic name and brief scope]
- ...

## Chunk 5 (Topics W-end): [Thematic Group Name]
Main topics to include:
- Topic W: [Topic name and brief scope]
- ...

Total Topics: [Estimate total number]
```

### Then Generate Each Chunk

After presenting the plan, generate each chunk sequentially. Each chunk should:
- Cover approximately 20% of the total curriculum (2-6 topics per chunk depending on subject complexity)
- Be a valid JSON array that can be concatenated with other chunks
- Include complete topic structures with all sub_topics and example_tasks

**Structure Requirements for Each Chunk**:
- Each chunk is a JSON array: `[{...}, {...}]`
- All chunks combined will form the complete curriculum array
- First chunk: `[{ topic_1 }, { topic_2 }, ...]`
- Middle chunks: `[{ topic_x }, { topic_y }, ...]`
- Last chunk: `[{ topic_n-1 }, { topic_n }]`

**Final Assembly**:
After all 5 chunks, confirm the total structure:
- Total main topics: [count]
- Total subtopics: [estimate]
- Total example tasks: [estimate]
- Estimated JSON size: [characters]

Example of CORRECT chunk format:
```json
[
  { "key": "topic_1", "name": "...", "sub_topics": [...] },
  { "key": "topic_2", "name": "...", "sub_topics": [...] }
]
```

**DO NOT** wrap in an object with "grade_3_6" key
