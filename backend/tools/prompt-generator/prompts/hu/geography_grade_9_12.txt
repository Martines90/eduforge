# Curriculum Mapping Prompt: Geography for Hungary

You are an expert curriculum analyst specializing in Hungary's official national education standards for Geography.

Your task is to create a comprehensive, hierarchical JSON structure that maps the complete Geography curriculum for grades 9-12 according to Hungary's official government education standards: Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT).

---

## 1. Research and Accuracy Requirements

Authoritative Sources:
- Base your structure on the official Ministry of Education and Culture (Oktatási és Kulturális Minisztérium) curriculum documents
- Follow the Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT) standards and framework
- Ensure accuracy to Hungary's actual teaching practices and pedagogical approaches
- Use terminology and concepts standard in Hungary's education system

Grade Level Context:
- Grade 9-10: Középiskola 9-10. évfolyam
- Grade 11-12: Középiskola 11-12. évfolyam

## 2. JSON Structure Format

Follow this exact hierarchical structure:

```json
{
  "grade_9_10": [
    {
      "key": "unique_topic_key",
      "name": "Topic Name in Hungarian",
      "short_description": "Brief description of the topic scope and key learning goals (1-2 sentences)",
      "sub_topics": [
        {
          "key": "unique_subtopic_key",
          "name": "Subtopic Name in Hungarian",
          "short_description": "Brief description of what students will learn in this subtopic",
          "sub_topics": [
            {
              "key": "unique_sub_subtopic_key",
              "name": "Detailed Concept Name in Hungarian",
              "short_description": "Specific learning objective or skill to be mastered",
              "example_tasks": [
                "Example task 1 that demonstrates this concept (age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned)",
                "Example task 2 with slightly different approach or difficulty",
                "Example task 3 showing practical application or real-world connection"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "grade_11_12": [
    // Same hierarchical structure as grade_9_10
  ]
}
```

## 3. Depth and Coverage Requirements

Breadth (Horizontal Coverage):
- Grade 9-10: Include 12-14 main topics that cover the full curriculum for these grades
- Grade 11-12: Include 12-14 main topics that cover the full curriculum for these grades
- Total main topics across both grade levels: 16-24

Depth (Vertical Hierarchy):
- Level 1 (Main Topics): 12-14 per grade level
- Level 2 (Sub Topics): 3-6 per main topic
- Level 3 (Sub Topics with example Tasks): 3 tasks (only if really needed 4-5 tasks) per detailed sub topic

Note: at level to if it make sense you can already add example tasks (in case if no sub topics can be added vertically there)

Total Size Target:
- Minimum 2,400-2,500 lines of JSON
- Minimum 300-400 lines / chunk (in total 2400)
- Minimum 140,000-180,000 characters in total
- This ensures comprehensive coverage of the entire 4-year secondary curriculum

## 4. Content Quality Standards

### Language and Terminology:
- All names and descriptions MUST be in Hungarian
- Use official terminology from Hungary's education system
- Keys should be in lowercase_with_underscores (English or transliterated)
- Be consistent with naming conventions throughout

### Short Descriptions:
- Keep to 1-2 sentences (concise but informative)
- Focus on learning objectives and key concepts
- Use pedagogically accurate language
- Align with official curriculum language and goals

### Example Tasks:
Each example task must be:
- Authentic: Reflect the types of assessments and exercises used in Hungary
- Age-appropriate: Suitable for the cognitive level of the grade
- Progressive: Show increasing complexity across the 3-5 examples
- Curriculum-aligned: Match the learning objectives of the official curriculum
- Practical: Where possible, connect to real-world contexts relevant to Hungary
- Diverse: Cover different cognitive levels (recall, application, analysis, synthesis)
- Clear: Fully specified so a student or teacher understands what is being asked

### Progression:
- Ensure logical progression from Grade 9-10 to Grade 11-12
- Build on prerequisite knowledge appropriately
- Increase complexity and abstraction in later grades
- Reflect the actual sequencing in Hungary's curriculum

---


### Subject-Specific Requirements for Geography:

Core Topics to Include:
- Physical Geography (landforms, climate, ecosystems, natural disasters)
- Human Geography (population, urbanization, migration, culture)
- Economic Geography (resources, industries, trade, development)
- Political Geography (borders, geopolitics, territorial disputes)
- Environmental Geography (sustainability, climate change, conservation)
- Cartography and GIS (map reading, spatial analysis)
- Regional Geography (continents, countries, with emphasis on home country/region)

Pedagogical Considerations:
- Integrate physical and human geography
- Use maps, satellite imagery, and geographic data
- Connect local, regional, and global scales
- Address contemporary issues (climate change, urbanization, globalization)
- Develop spatial thinking and map literacy

Example Task Types:
- Map interpretation and analysis
- Climate graph and data analysis
- Case study analysis of regions or countries
- Fieldwork and observation tasks
- Problem-solving related to environmental or development issues
- Comparison of geographic regions or phenomena

## 5. Curriculum Alignment Checklist

Before and during your work, ensure:
- [ ] You have researched the official Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT)
- [ ] All main topics reflect mandatory content in the curriculum
- [ ] Topic sequence matches the typical teaching order in Hungary
- [ ] Time allocation and emphasis match curriculum priorities
- [ ] Assessment types in example tasks reflect Hungary's evaluation methods
- [ ] Cultural context is appropriate (examples, references, applications)
- [ ] Language is natural and authentic for Hungarian

## 6. Delivery Format (In Chunks)

Since this is a large dataset (~3000-3500 lines), deliver it in manageable chunks.

### Step 1: Overview
First, provide a complete overview listing:
1. All main topics for grade_9_10 (with brief 1-sentence descriptions)
2. All main topics for grade_11_12 (with brief 1-sentence descriptions)
3. Confirmation that this structure aligns with Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT)
4. Estimated line count and character count for the full output

Wait for approval before proceeding to chunks.

### Step 2: Deliver Chunks
After approval, deliver the full JSON data in chunks as follows:

Chunk 1: `grade_9_10` array - First 3-4 main topics (complete with all sub_topics, sub_sub_topics, and example_tasks)

Chunk 2: `grade_9_10` array - Next 3-4 main topics

Chunk 3: `grade_9_10` array - Next 3-4 main topics

Chunk 4: `grade_9_10` array - Remaining main topics

Chunk 5: `grade_11_12` array - First 3-4 main topics

Chunk 6: `grade_11_12` array - Next 3-4 main topics

Chunk 7: `grade_11_12` array - Next 3-4 main topics

Chunk 8: `grade_11_12` array - Remaining main topics

IMPORTANT: The `grade_9_10` and `grade_11_12` keys should contain arrays directly, NOT objects with a "topics" key. The structure should be:
```json
{
  "grade_9_10": [ /* array of topics */ ],
  "grade_11_12": [ /* array of topics */ ]
}
```

### Chunk Completion Format:
After each chunk, state:

```
✅ Chunk [X] of [TOTAL] complete.
📊 Character count for this chunk: [XXXXX]
📈 Cumulative character count: [XXXXXX] / ~160,000-190,000
🔄 Ready for next chunk? Reply 'continue' to proceed to Chunk [X+1].
```

---

## 7. Final Validation

After delivering all chunks, provide:
1. Total line count
2. Total character count
3. Confirmation that all main topics from the overview are included
4. Self-check that content aligns with Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT)

---

## 8. Important Notes

- DO NOT hallucinate or invent curriculum content. If you are unsure about specific topics in Hungary's curriculum, indicate this and use general best practices for the subject.
- Prioritize accuracy over creativity. This data will be used for educational purposes.
- Be consistent with JSON formatting, key naming, and structure throughout all chunks.
- All content must be in Hungarian except for keys.

## Ready to Begin?

Please confirm:
1. You understand the task and requirements
2. You have identified authoritative sources for Hungary's Geography curriculum
3. You are ready to provide content in Hungarian
4. You will deliver an overview first, then await approval before providing chunks

Please start with the overview (Step 1).

At chunk 1 also include "grade_9_10" key
At chunk 5 also include "grade_11_12" key

The other chunks should only presented {},{}, ... so i can copy paste them easily into the actual "grade_":[...] array.
