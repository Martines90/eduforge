# Curriculum Mapping Prompt: Mathematics for Hungary (Grade 9-12)

You are an expert curriculum analyst specializing in Hungary's official national education standards for Mathematics.

Your task is to create a comprehensive, hierarchical JSON structure that maps the complete Mathematics curriculum for Grade 9-12 (9-12, ages 14-18) according to Hungary's official government education standards: Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT).

## 1. Research and Accuracy Requirements

Authoritative Sources:
- Base your structure on the official Ministry of Education and Culture (Oktatási és Kulturális Minisztérium) curriculum documents
- Follow the Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT) standards and framework
- Ensure accuracy to Hungary's actual teaching practices and pedagogical approaches
- Use terminology and concepts standard in Hungary's education system

Grade Level Context:
- Grade Range: 9-12
- Local Label: 9-12. osztály
- Age Range: 14-18
- Teacher Role: Középiskolai tanár

---

## 2. JSON Structure Format

Follow this exact hierarchical structure:

```json
{
  "grade_9_12": [
    {
      "key": "unique_topic_key",
      "name": "Topic Name in Hungarian",
      "short_description": "Brief description of the topic scope and key learning goals (1-2 sentences)",
      "sub_topics": [
        {
          "key": "unique_subtopic_key",
          "name": "Subtopic Name in Hungarian",
          "short_description": "Brief description of what students will learn in this subtopic",
          "sub_topics": [
            {
              "key": "unique_sub_subtopic_key",
              "name": "Detailed Concept Name in Hungarian",
              "short_description": "Specific learning objective or skill to be mastered",
              "example_tasks": [
                "Example task 1 that demonstrates this concept (age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned)",
                "Example task 2 with slightly different approach or difficulty",
                "Example task 3 showing practical application or real-world connection"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Depth and Coverage Requirements

Breadth (Horizontal Coverage):
- Include 10-14 main topics that cover the full curriculum for Grade 9-12
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all mandatory content areas

Depth (Vertical Hierarchy):
- Level 1 (Main Topics): 10-14 topics
- Level 2 (Sub Topics): 3-6 per main topic
- Level 3 (Sub Topics with example Tasks): 3-5 tasks per detailed sub topic

Total Size Target:
- Minimum 800-1200 lines of JSON for this grade level
- Minimum 50,000-80,000 characters
- This ensures comprehensive coverage of the curriculum for 9-12

---

## 4. Content Quality Standards

### Language and Terminology:
- All names and descriptions MUST be in Hungarian
- Use official terminology from Hungary's education system
- Keys should be in lowercase_with_underscores (English or transliterated)
- Be consistent with naming conventions throughout

### Short Descriptions:
- Keep to 1-2 sentences (concise but informative)
- Focus on learning objectives and key concepts
- Use pedagogically accurate language
- Align with official curriculum language and goals

### Example Tasks:
Each example task must be:
- Authentic: Reflect the types of assessments and exercises used in Hungary
- Age-appropriate: Suitable for ages 14-18
- Progressive: Show increasing complexity across the 3-5 examples
- Curriculum-aligned: Match the learning objectives of the official curriculum
- Practical: Where possible, connect to real-world contexts relevant to Hungary
- Diverse: Cover different cognitive levels (recall, application, analysis, synthesis)
- Clear: Fully specified so a student or teacher understands what is being asked

---


### Subject-Specific Requirements for Mathematics:

Core Topics to Include:
- Algebra (equations, inequalities, functions, polynomials)
- Geometry (plane geometry, solid geometry, coordinate geometry, transformations)
- Trigonometry (angles, functions, identities, applications)
- Calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals) [for higher grades]
- Statistics and Probability (data analysis, distributions, inference)
- Number Theory (divisibility, primes, modular arithmetic)
- Sequences and Series
- Mathematical Logic and Proof Techniques

Pedagogical Considerations:
- Progress from concrete to abstract reasoning
- Include both pure mathematics and real-world applications
- Ensure example tasks cover: calculation, proof, problem-solving, and modeling
- Balance procedural fluency with conceptual understanding
- Include visual/geometric representations where applicable

Example Task Types:
- Computation and calculation problems
- Proof and reasoning tasks
- Applied word problems from real-world contexts
- Multi-step problem-solving
- Pattern recognition and generalization

## 5. Curriculum Alignment Checklist

Before and during your work, ensure:
- [ ] You have researched the official Nemzeti Alaptanterv (NAT) for 9-12
- [ ] All main topics reflect mandatory content for Grade 9-12
- [ ] Topic sequence matches the typical teaching order in Hungary
- [ ] Content is age-appropriate for 14-18
- [ ] Examples are relevant for Középiskolai tanár teaching this level
- [ ] Cultural context is appropriate (examples, references, applications)
- [ ] Language is natural and authentic for Hungarian

## 6. Delivery Format

Deliver the complete JSON structure in one response if possible, or in 2-3 chunks if needed.

IMPORTANT: The structure should be:
```json
{
  "grade_9_12": [ /* array of topics */ ]
}
```
