> - **Impulse**: F·Δt = Δp → needs force and time
> - **Force**: F = ma → needs mass and acceleration
>
> **Your story must provide the EXACT variables needed for this formula.**
>

> ---
>
> ## STEP 3: ESTABLISH THE STAKES AND IMMERSE THE STUDENT
>
> **Frame the scenario in SECOND PERSON - place the STUDENT in the historical moment:**
>
> The student was THERE. They had to make the calculation. What was at stake?
>
> **CRITICAL NARRATION RULE: Use second-person perspective ("You are...", "You must...", "You witness...", "You need to...")**
>
> **Examples of properly framed scenarios:**
> - **In Ancient Engineering**: "You are consulting on the Hoover Dam in 1935. If you miscalculate the water pressure forces..."
> - **In Wartime**: "You are a Royal Air Force engineer during the Battle of Britain. You must calculate aircraft fuel loads. The kinetic energy at landing with different fuel weights determines survival."
> - **In Discovery**: "You stand with Marie Curie in her lab. You need to calculate the energy released by radium to understand what has been discovered."
> - **In Catastrophe**: "You are at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011. You witness the tsunami approaching. Understanding the kinetic energy of that wave wall means knowing what can stop it."
> - **In Innovation**: "You are a SpaceX engineer in 2020. You must calculate re-entry energy for Crew Dragon. Too much energy, and the crew dies. This is real."
>
> **Stakes are authentic when the STUDENT (addressed as "you"):**
> - Is placed at this historical moment as an active participant
> - Must make the calculation to solve a real problem
> - Understands that getting it wrong has measurable consequences
> - Uses mathematics as a tool for understanding or survival, not just curiosity
>
> ---
>
> ## STEP 4: VERIFY FORMULA ALIGNMENT
>
> **Critical check before writing:**
>
> Does your scenario provide the EXACT variables needed for the formula?
>
> **Example - Kinetic Energy (E_k = ½mv²):**
> - ✅ CORRECT: "Apollo 11 re-entry: capsule mass 5,900 kg, velocity 11,000 m/s. Calculate kinetic energy that must be dissipated."
> - ❌ WRONG: "Calculate force needed to stop the capsule in 10 seconds" (that's impulse F·Δt, not kinetic energy)
>
> **If your scenario needs different variables than the formula requires, STOP and redesign.**

> ## EXAMPLES USING SECOND-PERSON NARRATION
>
> **For Kinetic Energy (E_k = ½mv²):**
>
> **Title**: "Apolló 11 Visszatérése - 1969"
> **Story (Second Person)**: "You are at NASA Mission Control on July 24, 1969. Apollo 11 is coming home. The command module is screaming toward Earth at 11,000 m/s - faster than a bullet. You must understand the kinetic energy that needs to be dissipated through atmospheric friction. The module's mass: 5,900 kg. Get the re-entry angle wrong by even a degree, and that energy either burns the crew alive or bounces them back into space. You run the calculations. The numbers must be perfect."
> **Questions**: Calculate the kinetic energy of the command module at re-entry velocity. Compare this to re-entry at 9,000 m/s - how much less energy would need to be dissipated?
> **Stakes**: Three lives depending on understanding how velocity affects energy quadratically.
>
> **For Work/Force (W = F·s):**
>
> **Title**: "A Gízai Piramisok Építése - Kr.e. 2560"
> **Story (Second Person)**: "You are overseeing the construction of Khufu's Great Pyramid. Workers are dragging 2,500 kg limestone blocks up ramps. Every block requires calculating the work needed to move it. The ramps are 100 meters long at a 10-degree angle. You must help them understand: less steep means more distance but less force needed. Get it wrong, and workers die from exhaustion or the blocks slide back. The pyramid will stand for 4,500 years - but only if you understand the mathematics of work and force."
> **Questions**: Calculate the minimum work required to raise a 2,500 kg block 20 meters vertically. Would a longer, less steep ramp reduce the work needed?
> **Stakes**: Building a monument that will last millennia - physics must be right.
>
> ---
>
> ## REALISM VERIFICATION: THE 80% RULE
>
> **CRITICAL**: Your scenario must be **at least 80% realistic** - meaning it should feel like something that could have actually happened or could realistically happen in that profession, era, and situation.
>
> ### **Ask yourself these questions BEFORE submitting:**
>
> #### 1. **Would this ACTUALLY happen in this profession?**
> - ✅ GOOD: A gondolier needs to stop quickly to avoid attracting attention - this is plausible daily work
> - ✅ GOOD: A medieval siege engineer calculates catapult trajectory - this was their actual job
> - ✅ GOOD: A NASA engineer calculates re-entry angles - this is exactly what they do
> - ❌ BAD: A baker calculating orbital mechanics - bakers don't do this
> - ❌ BAD: A medieval peasant optimizing supply chain logistics - too modern/abstract for the era
> - ❌ BAD: A gondolier calculating escape velocity - completely outside their work scope
>
> #### 2. **Does the MATH APPLICATION make practical sense?**
> - ✅ GOOD: Calculating stopping force to prevent a passenger from falling - direct, immediate application
> - ✅ GOOD: Calculating bridge load capacity before construction - prevents collapse
> - ✅ GOOD: Computing artillery trajectory to hit a target - direct military need
> - ❌ BAD: Calculating kinetic energy "just to understand" without any action to take
> - ❌ BAD: Computing forces that no one in that era could measure or use
> - ❌ BAD: Math problems that feel like homework inserted into a story
>
> #### 3. **Would someone in this situation REALISTICALLY do this calculation?**
> - ✅ GOOD: A 1650s gondolier estimating how hard to brake - practical intuition they'd develop
> - ✅ GOOD: A ship captain calculating provisions for a voyage - essential for survival
> - ✅ GOOD: An engineer checking structural integrity before building - standard practice
> - ❌ BAD: A hunter-gatherer in 8000 BCE using calculus - anachronistic
> - ❌ BAD: Anyone stopping mid-crisis to calculate to 4 decimal places - unrealistic urgency
> - ❌ BAD: Characters solving math for no practical reason during action
>
> #### 4. **Are the NUMBERS and SCALE realistic?**
> - ✅ GOOD: A gondola with passenger weighing 180 kg total - realistic
> - ✅ GOOD: Gondola moving at 2.8 m/s - realistic rowing speed
> - ✅ GOOD: Stopping in 0.15 seconds - physically possible and relevant
> - ❌ BAD: A gondola weighing 5000 kg - way too heavy
> - ❌ BAD: A gondola moving at 20 m/s - impossibly fast for rowing
> - ❌ BAD: Numbers that seem randomly chosen without connection to reality
>
> #### 5. **Does the SITUATION fit the PROFESSION and ERA naturally?**
> - ✅ GOOD: A 1650s gondolier dealing with discretion/reputation - fits Venetian culture
> - ✅ GOOD: A 1940s codebreaker analyzing encrypted messages - fits their role
> - ✅ GOOD: A Roman engineer designing aqueduct water flow - fits their expertise
> - ❌ BAD: A gondolier suddenly involved in military strategy - wrong domain
> - ❌ BAD: A medieval monk doing industrial optimization - wrong era
> - ❌ BAD: Profession + era + situation feel randomly combined
>
> ### **Red Flags That Indicate LOW REALISM:**
>
> 🚩 **The math feels "inserted" rather than naturally emerging from the situation**
> 🚩 **The profession wouldn't realistically encounter this type of problem**
> 🚩 **The era doesn't have the technology/knowledge to measure these variables**
> 🚩 **The situation doesn't naturally lead to this calculation**
> 🚩 **The numbers seem arbitrary rather than researched/realistic**
> 🚩 **The consequences of getting the math wrong don't make practical sense**
> 🚩 **It feels like a textbook problem wearing a costume**
>
> ### **Green Flags That Indicate HIGH REALISM:**
>
> ✅ **The profession naturally encounters this type of physical situation**
> ✅ **The math directly helps solve an immediate practical problem**
> ✅ **The era and technology level match the problem complexity**
> ✅ **The numbers are scaled appropriately for the real-world context**
> ✅ **Someone in this job would actually think about this problem this way**
> ✅ **The situation flows naturally from the profession + era + circumstance**
> ✅ **It feels like you're learning about the real work, not just doing math**
>
> ### **The "Smell Test":**
>
> Read your scenario out loud and ask:
> - "Would a professional in this field nod and say 'Yes, this is how it works'?"
> - "Could this scenario appear in a documentary about this profession/era?"
> - "Does the math feel like a tool for solving the problem, or does the story feel like an excuse for the math?"
>
> **If you can't honestly answer "YES" to these questions, REDESIGN THE SCENARIO.**
>
> ---
>
> ## FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
>
> Before submitting, verify:
>
> ✅ **Realism**: Passes the 80% realism test - profession + situation + math application all make practical sense

> ## CRITICAL: USE SECOND-PERSON NARRATION TO IMMERSE THE STUDENT
>
> **Every task should feel like:**
> - The student is the protagonist in a war story from the trenches
> - The student stands beside history's greatest minds
> - The student witnesses humanity's triumphs and catastrophes firsthand
> - A teaching moment where the STUDENT is experiencing what mattered when stakes were real
>
> **Voice examples (Second Person):**
> - "You stand on the deck of the Titanic that night in 1912..."
> - "During the Manhattan Project, you calculate alongside Oppenheimer..."
> - "When the Challenger explodes in 1986, you must later understand the physics that killed them..."
> - "You are in Fukushima when the wave comes. The kinetic energy of water..."
> - "At the Battle of Thermopylae, you understand that force multipliers mean survival..."
>
> You are not creating textbook problems. You are placing students into **real moments from history** where mathematics was the difference between understanding and ignorance, success and failure, life and death.
>
> **Remember**: Address the student as "YOU" - they are living through every major event in human history. Every calculation they perform is one THEY must make when it matters. Immerse them in that endless well of human experience.
