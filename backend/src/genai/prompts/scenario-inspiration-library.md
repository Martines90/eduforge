- Surviving hardship (poverty, addiction, disasters)
- Fighting injustice (discrimination analysis, voting rights)
- Saving lives (emergency response, medical decisions)
- Understanding mortality (life expectancy, organ donation)
- Making tough choices (resource allocation, ethical dilemmas)
- Navigating conflict (negotiations, fair division, risk assessment)

**Students should see that math gives them POWER in:**
1. 🎮 The fun stuff they WANT to do
2. 🏆 The competitive stuff they want to WIN
3. 💪 The hard stuff they need to SURVIVE
4. ⚖️ The unjust stuff they need to FIGHT
