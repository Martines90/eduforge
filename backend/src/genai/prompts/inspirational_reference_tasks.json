The\nreports say 45 000 kg of this alloy were produced this\nyear.\nY our task is to calculate how many ballistic missiles\nRussia may have manufactured. T o do this, you need to\ndetermine how much of the EP0509394A1 alloy is\nrequired to produce the coating for a single missile\nwarhead.\nThe missile warheads typically have the following properties:\nThe warhead is a circular cone with:\n- Height: 114 cm,\n- Base Diameter: 77 cm.\nIt has a frustum cone section (started from the cone\nbase) coated with a height of 90 cm coated with this\nspecial EP0509394A1 alloy.\nThe coating uses:\n- Alloy thickness: 3 mm.\n- Density of the alloy: 10 950 kg / m3\n.\nGiven 45 000 kg of alloy, calculate how many\nfrustum sections can be coated.

Concerned for his people and the survival of his kingdom, the king\nsummons you, a renowned epidemiologist of the time, to predict the spread of the deadly plague and help\nhim prepare for the worst.\nFrance\n'\ns population is estimated at 16 million, divided into three distinct groups:\n- 15% live in major cities, such as Paris, which is bustling with commerce and dense with people.\n- 20% reside in towns, scattered across the countryside.\n- 65% live in villages and on farms, where life moves slowly, but isolation offers limited protection.\nThe spread of the plague varies depending on\npopulation density:\n- In major cities, the plague spreads rapidly due to the\nclose quarters, with a daily growth rate of 30%.\n- In towns, the spread is slower, with a daily growth\nrate of 20%.\n- In villages and on farms, the spread is even more\nsluggish due to the distance between people, with a\ndaily growth rate of 10%.\n- Note: The initial number of infected people is 50 in\neach group (cities, towns, villages-farms)\nKing Philip\n'\ns critical question to you: How many days\nwill it take for half of France’s population to be\ninfected?"

    "description": "The year is 1740, and the Catholic Church is determined to expand its influence and bring salvation to the\nindigenous people of Argentina. From its grand halls in Rome, the V atican has set its sights on a divine\nmission: to baptize 30% of the indigenous population within the next 20 years.\nA report from the Jesuit missionaries stationed in Argentina\npaints a vivid picture of the challenge. The indigenous\npopulation is vast, numbering approximately 280 000, and, so\nfar, only 7 800 people have been baptized. At present, there\nare 12 missionaries tirelessly working to spread the faith.\nEach missionary can baptize 30 people per year, but their\neffectiveness grows by the following formula:\nlast year rate * 1,1 = new rate.\nevery year as the baptized community expands. Inspired\nconverts bring others to the faith, increasing the rate of\nbaptisms for all missionaries proportionally to the size of the\nbaptized community.\nThe V atican knows it cannot rely solely on the current\nmissionaries to achieve this ambitious goal. The Sacred College\nis deliberating how many additional missionaries must be\ndispatched to Argentina to meet the target. The indigenous\npopulation must be reached, and the Church’\ns mission cannot\nfail.\nBut how many missionaries are needed? Can the Church\nensure that, within two decades, 30% of the population\nembraces the Catholic faith? The V atican’\ns leaders turn to their\nmost skilled planners to find the answer. Calculate the\nreinforcements required for this holy mission."

T o convince the king, you can rely\nsolely on factual comparisons. The circulating gold and silver coins wear down by 0,1% per year due to\nusage. Additionally, counterfeiters dilute 10% of the coins annually with 5% inferior metal and scrape\noff 1% of the material from 3% of the coins each year.\nThere are 100 000 gold coins and 10 million silver coins in circulation. The exchange rate between gold\nand silver coins is 1 gold = 100 silver.\nIn the case of banknotes, the printing cost is expected to be\n0,01 silver per banknote, and 1% of banknotes has to be\nre-printed annually. Counterfeiters are also active,\nintroducing 3000 counterfeit banknotes annually,\nleading to losses as they counterfeit 0,1 gold-value\ndenominations.\nA total of 11 million gold- and silver-backed banknotes\nare planned to be put into circulation and their represented\ntotal value equals with the currently circulating gold/silver\ncoins.\nUsing this information, calculate the predicted losses\nover 10 years and compare the losses incurred for both\ntypes (gold/silver vs banknote) of payment methods."

    "description": "The Moon and Sun in our solar system exhibit a\nrare and remarkable coincidence: their\nsize-to-distance ratios are so close that they\nallow for the phenomenon of total solar\neclipses, where the Moon perfectly covers the\nSun’\ns disk as seen from Earth. But how likely is\nthis alignment in the vast universe, where celestial\nbodies come in all sizes and distances?\nT o estimate this probability, you\n’ll investigate the\nMoon’\ns size-to-distance ratio and compare it with\nthe possible range of such ratios across moons,\nplanets, and stars. Using data from our galaxy, you\nwill calculate how often the Moon\n'\ns ratio could\nalign closely with a Sun-like star.\nHere is a simplified dataset representing the middle 80% ranges of key celestial properties (focusing on\n\"\nordinary\n\"\nmoons, planets, and stars):\n- Moon Sizes (Diameters): Range: 1 000 km − 5 000 km\n- Planet Sizes (Diameters): Range: 4 000 km − 120 000 km\n- Planet-Sun Distances (Semi-Major Axes): Range: 50 million km − 6 000 million km\n- Sun Sizes (Diameters): Range: 100 000 km − 2 000 000 km\n- Moon-Planet Distances: Range: 50 000 km − 2 000 000 km\nThe Moon is approximately 3 474 km in diameter (size) and its average distance from Earth is about\n384 400 km. The Sun’\ns diameter (size) is about 1 391 000 km, and the Earth-Sun distance is\napproximately 149 600 000 km.\nSize-to-distance ratio formulas :\n𝑀𝑜𝑜𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒\nRatioMoon\n𝑀𝑜𝑜𝑛−𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒\n𝑆𝑢𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒\nRatioSun\n=\n𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑡−𝑆𝑢𝑛 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒\n,\nΔRatio = |RatioMoon - RatioSun|\n,\nUsing the provided ranges for moon sizes,\nmoon-planet distances, sun sizes, and planet-sun\ndistances, calculate the probability that a\nrandomly selected moon-planet-sun system will\nproduce a moon ratio and sun ratio within the\nsame tolerance ratio as the Moon-Sun-Earth\nsystem, allowing for a perfect eclipse.\n="

The cannon emits sound waves at a current sound level of 115 dB, which is\neffective but not yet optimized for all scenarios. The headquarters requests the development of three\nstronger versions of the cannon, with sound intensity levels that are 3 times stronger, 5 times stronger\nand 10 times stronger than the current prototype.\nY our task is to calculate the expected decibel values for\nthese stronger versions of the sound cannon. Use the\nformula for comparing sound levels in decibels:\nL2 = L1 + 10 * log10 (R)\nWhere:\n- L1 is the current decibel value (115dB).\n- L2 is the decibel value of the stronger version.\n- R is the intensity ratio (3, 5, or 10 times stronger).\nCalculate the decibel values that a sound cannon\nwould need to produce if it were 3 times\nstronger, 5 times stronger, and 10 times stronger."

    "description": "Long ago, in a quiet valley, you were the first farmer to master the\nart of corn breeding. Each season, you carefully choose seeds\nfrom the best plants, striving to improve your humble crop. The\njourney was not easy—your corn plants started with a modest\nyield of 12 seeds per plant, but your dedication brought\nremarkable progress.\nThrough selective breeding, you discovered that your plants grew\nstronger with each generation, improving their yield by 33%\nmore seeds than the previous harvest. But nature was not\nwithout its challenges. As your plants grew more productive,\nthey also became more vulnerable to pests and diseases caused by\npesticides. This vulnerability increased cumulatively by 10% of\nall the seeds produced in previous generations.\nFor generations, you watched this delicate balance play out. On\none hand, the corn’\ns yield grew exponentially; on the other, the\nvulnerability reduced some of your progress. Y ou knew that your\ntask was a race against nature itself: could you improve your crop\nto produce at least 50 seeds per plant, despite the ever-growing\nrisks?\nCalculate how many generations will it\ntake for your corn plants to reach this\ngoal.\nWith each passing year, the balance of growth\nand vulnerability will test your wisdom.

    "description": "In 1966, as the newly elected mayor of Caracas (V enezuela), you face the challenge of dealing with one of the\nbiggest problems: earthquakes. The last relatively big earthquake had a 4,7-magnitude that has shaken your\ntown. Since most of the buildings are already quite old and were not constructed using the most modern\ntechnologies or materials, even this relatively modest earthquake has caused significant material damage. The\nworse news is that, according to geological institute forecasts and historical data, this earthquake could\nmerely be a precursor to a much larger wave of earthquakes expected in the near future. Earthquakes with\nmagnitudes of 6 to 7 are also possible.\nNot wanting to let a larger disaster occur, your first step is to sit down with local disaster management\nofficials to determine how much stronger earthquakes with magnitudes of 5,5, 6, or even 7 would be\ncompared to the 4,7-magnitude earthquake that just occurred.\nYou use the Richter scale magnitude formula:\n𝐴\nM = log10 ( 𝐴0\n) where:\n- M is the magnitude of the earthquake.\n- A is the amplitude of the earthquake\n'\ns seismic waves.\n- A0 is a reference amplitude.\nThe difference in magnitude is calculated using:\nΔM = MB - MA where\n- MB is the new (bigger) magnitude, MA is the\nreference magnitude.\nDetermine, using the Richter scale formula, how\nmuch stronger the effects of earthquakes with\nmagnitudes of 5,5, 6, and 7 would be compared to the original 4,7-magnitude earthquake."

At that time, it did not exhibit significant signs of the red giant phase,\nand its diameter was measured at 55 656 000 km. However, its current size and luminosity fully confirm its\nred giant status. Astronomers named it Aurelexis-RG-7.\nIn 2010, an amateur astronomer studied the star and noted that its diameter had grown to 55 661 084 km.\nIn 2024, you conducted your own measurement of the same star, finding that its diameter had further\nincreased to 55 674 645 km.\nThis observation could be of historical significance because the red giant phase of stars, measured on a\nhuman timescale, spans an immense duration of approximately 1,2 billion years. However, the most active\nphase of growth typically occurs in the last few million years. Observing this rapid growth at its onset is\ntherefore quite rare.\nY ou aim to contribute accurate data to the astronomy\ncommunity by answering the following questions:\nPrecisely when (what year) did this star begin\ntransitioning into the hyperactive growth phase of\nits red giant lifecycle? (Ignore the 1990 data, as the\nstar’\ns size growth was too slow to be significant at\nthat time.)\nWhat is the percentage growth rate of its diameter\nannually?\n(97)"

Y ou have 10 000 defenders entrenched along the cliffs, but they are heavily outnumbered.\nWithout reinforcements, this sector is at risk of falling.\nAt Utah Beach, 10 000 Allied troops are advancing against 120 000 defenders. This position is stronger,\nbut moving reinforcements from here to Omaha Beach could weaken the line enough to allow a\nbreakthrough.\nIf either beach falls, the Allies will establish a foothold in Normandy, and the battle will be lost. You can\nmove defenders between the two beaches to balance your forces, but you must act wisely.\nThe outcome at each beach depends on the ratio of defenders to attackers. Y our chances of holding both\npositions are determined by the combined odds:\n𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑎𝑡 𝑂𝑚𝑎ℎ𝑎\n𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑎𝑡 𝑈𝑡𝑎ℎ\nT otal Odds = ( )*( )\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝑎𝑡 𝑂𝑚𝑎ℎ𝑎\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝑎𝑡 𝑈𝑡𝑎ℎ\nCalculate how many defenders you have to move to Omaha Beach to maximize the chances of\nholding both positions.

    "description": "Y our company is designing a cake-slicing machine\nfor pastry shops. Y ou are responsible for the\nprogram that controls the machine. Cakes are\nplaced on a rotating platform, and the desired\nnumber of slices is entered into the system. The\nmachine then cuts the cake into equal slices. The\nblade of the machine cuts across the entire\ndiameter of the cake. Cakes must have at least 4\nslices and at most 32 slices.\nDetermine the appropriate parameters to replace\nthe \"???\" placeholders in the pseudocode!\nAdditionally, using the test data, determine how\nmany cuts the machine needs to slice cakes into 6,\n16, 24, and 32 slices, as well as the degree of\nrotation per cut."

Your task, as one of the engineers on\nthe support team, is to calculate the distance at\nwhich the subject will land.\nThe performer is shot at an initial velocity of v0\n= 50 m / s at an angle of 45° to the horizontal\nground. The launch height is h0 = 10 m.\nKey Concepts and Formulas\nVertical Motion (Height):\nThe performer\n'\ns height given by: h(t) = h0 + v0yt −\n1\n2\n2 𝑔𝑡\nWhere:\n- h0 = 10 m (initial height),\n- v0y\n= v0\n* sin( θ) is the initial vertical velocity,\n- θ = 45°\n- g = 9,8 m / s\n2 (gravitational acceleration),\n- t is the time in seconds.\nHorizontal Motion (Distance):\nThe horizontal distance x(t) traveled is: x(t) = v0xt\nWhere:\n- v0x\n= v0 * cos(θ) is the initial horizontal velocity.\n- t is the time in seconds.\nYour task is to determine how far horizontally (distance) the performer will travel before\nhitting the ground."

    "description": "In the Grand Republic of Orbis, democracy has evolved into a new era with the Balanced Voting System\n(BVS)—a system where votes are weighted based on the voter\n'\ns engagement with the subject matter. This\nweek, the United Progress Alliance (UPA), one of the most influential parties, has triggered a national\nreferendum using one of its Monthly Voting Starter Credits.\nThe Proposal: A $5 Billion Nuclear Power Plant\nThe topic of the referendum is whether the government should allocate $5 billion to construct a new\nNuclear Power Plant. The proposal has sparked a fierce ideological battle among the major political\nforces of Orbis.\nThe Political Battlefield\nOrbis has five key political parties, each with\nvarying levels of influence:\n- United Progress Alliance (UPA - A):\n1 345 233 votes\n- People’s Freedom Movement (PFM - B):\n1 710 541 votes\n- Green Future Initiative (GFI - C):\n99 455 votes\n- Traditional Values Front (TVF - D):\n245 222 votes\n- Economic Stability League (ESL - E):\n970 039 votes\nEach party receives Monthly Voting Starter Credits in proportion to their election results, calculated as:\nVoting Starter Credits = ( 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑦 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠\n𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠 )\nx 10\n*Rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n*Minimum 1 credit granted for parties surpassing 5% of the votes.\nPhase 1: The War of Words\n- UPA (A) and TVF (D) strongly support the\nproject and publish detailed arguments\npromoting the benefits of nuclear energy.\n- PFM (B) and ESL (E) oppose the project,\npublishing counter-arguments highlighting the\nrisks and financial burden.\n* All parties use all of their Article Credits to\ninfluence public opinion.\nPhase 2: The Reaction Storm\n- Each party that published pro/con articles now\nhas the opportunity to respond to every opposing argument with reaction articles.\n- These reactions aim to counter criticisms, defend initial positions, and convince undecided voters.\nPhase 3: The Last Stand\n- The original authors of the pro/con critical articles get one final opportunity to defend their stance\nwith a comment article aimed at dismantling the opposition’\ns reaction articles.\nPhase 4: The Final Vote\nAfter an intense debate, it is now\nup to the people to make the\nfinal decision. But in this system,\nnot all votes carry the same\nweight—they are determined\nby how much effort the voter\nput into understanding the\ntopic.\nMeet the Voters:\nJack – The Uninterested Citizen\nJack doesn’t particularly care about this topic. He skims through the\nNuclear Power Plant description and passes the system-generated\ncustom comprehension test —and casts his vote against the\nproject without engaging further.\nJack’s Vote Worth: 10 points\nEve – The Biased Voter\nEve participates in the vote not because she deeply cares about nuclear\nenergy, but because she strongly dislikes UPA (A) and TVF (D). She\ncompletes the voting description and reads every major contra\narticle published by PFM (B) and ESL (E), reinforcing her belief that\nthe project is a terrible idea.\nEve’s Vote Worth: 35 points\nKevin – The Ideal Voter\nKevin is committed to understanding all perspectives before\nmaking his decision. He thoroughly reads the voting description,\nevery pro/con article, every reaction article, and every comment\narticle to grasp the full picture before casting his vote.\nKevin’s Vote Worth: 118 points\nAlice – The Loyalist\nAlice has one favorite party: UPA\n(A). She only cares about political debates that directly involve them.\nShe reads the voting description, every article published by UPA (A),\nall reaction articles targeting these articles, but she ignored all the\nUPA’s responses to these reaction articles.\nAlice’s Vote Worth: 37 points\nBen – The Casual Voter\nBen doesn’t have much time to follow political debates. He completes\nthe voting description, then finds one pro article from UPA (A)\nthat catches his eye, reads it, then reads one related reaction article\nand its corresponding final rebuttal comment.\nBen’s Vote Worth: 22 points\nBased on the given voter scores, calculate the voting score value of each type of content completion."
