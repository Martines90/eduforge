# Generic Specification for Exceptional Math Task Design

## Core Design Philosophy

Transform abstract mathematical concepts into EXCITING, HIGH-STAKES narratives where problem-solving becomes an adventure with real consequences. Kids should feel like heroes solving critical challenges, not just students doing homework.

**MAKE IT COOL:** Think video games, space missions, extreme sports, treasure hunts, spy missions, survival scenarios, competitions with real stakes, scientific discoveries, or saving the day. Boring = coffee shops, basic shopping, simple daily tasks. COOL = adventure, danger, competition, discovery, achievement!

## Essential Components

### 1. **Narrative Framework (Required)**

- **Adventure/Challenge Anchor**: Ground the problem in an EXCITING scenario - space exploration, extreme sports competition, treasure hunt, spy mission, survival challenge, gaming tournament, scientific breakthrough, or rescue operation
- **Hero Role Assignment**: Cast the solver as someone doing something COOL with real stakes:
  - ✅ COOL: astronaut, game designer, athlete, detective, explorer, inventor, rescue coordinator, esports champion, marine biologist, drone pilot
  - ❌ BORING: barista, shopkeeper, accountant, everyday person doing routine tasks
- **Real Stakes**: The outcome must MATTER - winning a championship, saving lives, breaking a record, discovering something important, preventing disaster, claiming treasure
- **Time Pressure**: Include countdown, deadline, or race-against-time element to create urgency

### 2. **Problem Context Structure**

- **Explosive Opening Hook** (50-80 characters): Drop the solver into ACTION immediately - the countdown has started, the competition is live, the mission is critical
- **High-Stakes Setup** (150-250 characters): Describe the challenge with EXCITEMENT - What's at risk? What are you competing against? What will you discover/achieve/save?
- **Competing Factors with Drama**: Present challenges, obstacles, or competing elements that make the problem exciting - limited resources in survival, opponents in competition, dangers to overcome
- **Concrete Data Presentation**: Embed all numerical values within the exciting narrative - numbers should feel like mission parameters, not homework data

### 3. **Data Integration Style**

- **Mission-Critical Data**: Present numbers as vital intel, game stats, survival metrics, or competition parameters (e.g., "sensors detect 9,500 hostile drones approaching" not "Team A: 9,500 workers")
- **Realistic Precision**: Use specific numbers that feel authentic to the scenario (3.98 miles remaining oxygen range, not 4 miles)
- **Asymmetry for Realism**: Avoid perfectly round numbers - real missions, games, and challenges have messy, real data
- **Units as Context**: Include units that enhance the scenario's coolness (mph for racing speeds, feet for diving depth, degrees F for extreme temperatures)

### 4. **Challenge Articulation**

- **Hero's Decision**: Frame the task as a CRITICAL calculation that determines success or failure - "Can you make it?", "Will you win?", "Can you save them?"
- **Action Verbs with Impact**: Use powerful verbs: "calculate to survive," "determine if you can win," "compute before time runs out," "solve to unlock," "find the answer to succeed"
- **Clear Victory Conditions**: State exactly what success looks like and what's at stake
- **Pure Question Format**: The question should NEVER hint at the solution method.
  - ❌ BAD: "Calculate using 2³ and 3×7 to find..."
  - ✅ GOOD: "How many grams total do you need?"

### 5. **Linguistic Quality Standards**

- **Dynamic Pacing**: Mix short, punchy sentences with longer ones for drama - "Time is running out. You have one shot. Can you calculate fast enough?"
- **Active, Exciting Voice**: Use present tense and active voice to create immediacy - "You're diving deeper," not "You were diving"
- **Cool Vocabulary**: Use exciting, age-appropriate terms - "mission critical," "game-changing," "breakthrough," "race against time"
- **Build Tension**: Escalate from setup to challenge, making each paragraph raise the stakes

### 6. **Mathematical Authenticity**

- **Real-World Complexity**: Numbers should reflect actual measurements, not simplified textbook values
- **Logical Constraints**: All given information should be necessary; avoid red herrings unless pedagogically intentional
- **Solution Path**: Ensure the problem requires the target mathematical concept(s) and has a deterministic solution
- **Implicit Assumptions**: Allow for reasonable assumptions a professional would make (e.g., linear relationships, proportional scaling)

## Structural Template

**[OPENING]** (50-100 words)

- Time period and setting
- Solver's role and authority
- Overarching project/challenge

**[SITUATION DEVELOPMENT]** (100-150 words)

- Present Element A with embedded data
- Present Element B with embedded data
- Establish the tension or imbalance between elements
- Include relevant constraints or conditions

**[CHALLENGE]** (40-70 words)

- Professional imperative (what you must do)
- Specific question requiring calculation
- Success criteria (what must be achieved)

## Technical Specifications

**Character Count**: 1,200 - 1,800 characters (including spaces)

- Minimum: 1,200 ensures sufficient context and immersion
- Maximum: 1,800 maintains single-page readability with accompanying illustration

**Paragraph Structure**: 3-4 paragraphs recommended

- Opening context: 1 paragraph
- Detailed situation: 1-2 paragraphs
- Challenge/question: 1 paragraph

**Numerical Precision**:

- Use 2-4 significant figures for realism
- Include decimals where appropriate to the context
- Vary precision levels (some round, some precise)

## Quality Differentiators (What Makes It Exceptional)

1. **Immersive vs. Instructional**: Reads like a professional briefing, not a textbook exercise
2. **Contextual Data**: Numbers emerge from story rather than being presented in isolation
3. **Professional Agency**: Solver has authority and responsibility, not just following instructions
4. **Authentic Complexity**: Reflects real-world messiness while remaining solvable
5. **Temporal Grounding**: Specific dates/eras create tangibility
6. **Human Stakes**: Solution matters for project completion, team coordination, resource allocation
7. **Visual Potential**: Scenario naturally suggests accompanying period-appropriate illustration
8. **Vocabulary Richness**: Domain-specific terms without unnecessary jargon

## What to AVOID

❌ BORING scenarios that kill excitement:
- Coffee shops, grocery shopping, basic cooking, typical school situations
- Generic travel problems ("Two trains leave stations...")
- Everyday routine tasks with no stakes
- Scenarios where nothing exciting happens

❌ TECHNICAL mistakes that weaken engagement:
- Artificially round numbers (100, 50, 25)
- Data presented in lists or tables within narrative
- Passive voice that kills energy
- Questions that reveal solution methods (e.g., "Calculate using 2³ and 3×7...")
- Asking "Show your work" or "Explain your reasoning" (keep focus on the answer)
- Mathematical terminology that spoils the discovery

✅ INSTEAD aim for:
- Adventure, competition, discovery, survival, achievement
- Realistic but exciting numbers
- Natural data integration
- Active, present-tense narration
- Pure questions that don't hint at methods
- Letting students discover the math approach themselves

## Note on Adaptability

This specification applies across all mathematical topics—from basic arithmetic to calculus—by adjusting the exciting scenario, stakes level, and technical vocabulary while maintaining HIGH ENGAGEMENT and real consequences.

## Story-Math Consistency Requirements (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY VALIDATION**: The story must logically align with the mathematical operations required to solve it.

1. **Time Unit Consistency**: If the story mentions "per week", "per day", "per hour", ensure calculations use these time units correctly
2. **Frequency Reasonableness**: Check that the final answer makes sense in the story context
   - Example BAD: "rehearses 3.85 hours per week" → calculation yields 51 rehearsals in 8 days (6.4/day) ❌
   - Example GOOD: "rehearses 3.85 hours per rehearsal" → 51 rehearsals in 8 days makes sense ✓
3. **Unit Conversion Clarity**: When converting units (days to hours, miles to feet), state it explicitly in the story
4. **Realistic Numbers**: Use numbers that result in reasonable final answers (not 1000 steps per day, not 0.001 items per year)

**BEFORE FINALIZING**: Ask yourself "Would this scenario actually make sense to someone solving it?" If the math produces absurd results given the story context, revise the story numbers.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**IMPORTANT**: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.

Return your response in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Short, engaging title that captures the scenario (5-10 words)",
  "story_chunks": [
    "First paragraph: Opening hook with time/place/role (50-100 words)",
    "Second paragraph: Situation development with Element A and embedded data (100-150 words). Use **bold** for key numerical values.",
    "Third paragraph: Element B, tension, constraints (80-120 words). Use **bold** for key numerical values.",
    "Fourth paragraph: The challenge and specific questions (40-70 words)"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Question A: Clear, specific question asking for quantitative answer",
    "Question B: Optional second question (ONLY if the problem naturally requires it)"
  ],
  "expected_answer_formats": [
    "Format for answer A (e.g., 'distance in kilometers to 2 decimal places')",
    "Format for answer B (optional, only if there's a second question)"
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use markdown **bold** formatting (double asterisks) to highlight key numerical values and important data points in your story. For example: "working at a pace of **0.41 miles per week**" or "completed **8.3 miles**".

**IMPORTANT NOTES ON QUESTIONS:**
- **Default: Use 1 question** - Most problems should have a single, focused question
- **Maximum: 2 questions (A and B)** - Only use 2 questions when:
  - The problem naturally has two distinct parts that build on each other
  - Both questions are essential to fully exploring the scenario
  - The second question adds pedagogical value (not just busywork)
- **DO NOT force multiple questions** - If the problem works well with one question, use one question
- **Questions should be labeled** as "A)" and "B)" in the last paragraph if there are 2

## MEASUREMENT SYSTEM AND NUMBER FORMATTING

**IMPERIAL SYSTEM** - Use these units and formatting conventions:

**Units to Use:**
- Distance: miles (mi), yards (yd), feet (ft), inches (in)
- Weight: pounds (lb), ounces (oz), tons
- Volume: gallons (gal), quarts (qt), pints (pt), fluid ounces (fl oz)
- Temperature: Fahrenheit (°F)
- Speed: mph, ft/s
- Area: square feet (ft²), acres

**Number Formatting (CRITICAL):**
- Decimal separator: **period** → `12.7 miles` (NOT 12,7)
- Thousands separator: **comma** → `112,233,222` (NOT 112 233 222)

**Examples:**
- `3.98 miles` (three point nine eight miles)
- `1,250,000 people` (one million two hundred fifty thousand)
- `0.05 seconds` (zero point zero five)
- `15.3 pounds` (fifteen point three pounds)

**Rules:**
- Use imperial system throughout the entire task
- Match decimal precision to real-world measurement practices
- Numbers should flow naturally in sentences
- Always include units - never write bare numbers
- Choose units that professionals would actually use in that scenario

---

Remember:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code blocks, no explanatory text
- All story chunks should be complete paragraphs with proper flow
- Embed all numerical data naturally within the narrative
- Use **bold** markdown formatting to highlight key numerical values
- Make the title compelling and era-specific
- Default to 1 question unless 2 questions genuinely enhance the problem
- Ensure each question is clear and unambiguous
- If using 2 questions, label them as A) and B) in the story
