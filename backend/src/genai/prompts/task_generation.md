# Generic Specification for Exceptional Math Task Design

## Core Design Philosophy

Transform abstract mathematical concepts into immersive narratives where problem-solving becomes a meaningful human endeavor with real stakes and context.

## Essential Components

### 1. **Narrative Framework (Required)**

- **Historical/Real-World Anchor**: Ground the problem in an authentic time period, profession, or scenario that actually existed or could plausibly exist
- **Role Assignment**: Cast the solver as a professional with authority and responsibility (engineer, architect, analyst, expedition leader, etc.)
- **Stakes and Purpose**: Establish why solving this problem matters—connect it to completion, success, or resolution of a significant challenge
- **Temporal Specificity**: Include exact dates, time periods, or deadlines to enhance realism

### 2. **Problem Context Structure**

- **Opening Hook** (50-80 characters): Begin with time/place/role to immediately establish context
- **Situation Setup** (150-250 characters): Describe the overarching project, challenge, or scenario
- **Dual/Multiple Elements**: Present at least two competing factors, teams, resources, or constraints that must be balanced or reconciled
- **Concrete Data Presentation**: Embed all numerical values within descriptive context rather than listing them separately

### 3. **Data Integration Style**

- **Naturalistic Embedding**: Weave numbers seamlessly into narrative sentences (e.g., "working with 9,500 laborers" not "Team A: 9,500 workers")
- **Precision with Purpose**: Use realistic, specific decimals that reflect actual measurement practices (3.98 km, not 4 km)
- **Asymmetry**: Avoid overly round or symmetrical numbers—reality is messy
- **Units Specified**: Always include appropriate units within the narrative flow

### 4. **Challenge Articulation**

- **Professional Voice**: Frame the task as a professional decision or calculation the solver must make in their role
- **Action-Oriented Language**: Use verbs like "determine," "reorganize," "calculate," "optimize," "ensure"
- **Constraint Specification**: Clearly state what must remain equal, balanced, optimized, or synchronized
- **Goal Clarity**: End with a precise question asking for a specific quantitative answer

### 5. **Linguistic Quality Standards**

- **Varied Sentence Structure**: Mix short and long sentences; avoid repetitive patterns
- **Active Voice Dominance**: Prioritize active constructions to maintain engagement
- **Professional Vocabulary**: Use domain-appropriate terminology without over-complicating
- **Transition Flow**: Connect ideas smoothly between setup, data, and challenge

### 6. **Mathematical Authenticity**

- **Real-World Complexity**: Numbers should reflect actual measurements, not simplified textbook values
- **Logical Constraints**: All given information should be necessary; avoid red herrings unless pedagogically intentional
- **Solution Path**: Ensure the problem requires the target mathematical concept(s) and has a deterministic solution
- **Implicit Assumptions**: Allow for reasonable assumptions a professional would make (e.g., linear relationships, proportional scaling)

## Structural Template

**[OPENING]** (50-100 words)

- Time period and setting
- Solver's role and authority
- Overarching project/challenge

**[SITUATION DEVELOPMENT]** (100-150 words)

- Present Element A with embedded data
- Present Element B with embedded data
- Establish the tension or imbalance between elements
- Include relevant constraints or conditions

**[CHALLENGE]** (40-70 words)

- Professional imperative (what you must do)
- Specific question requiring calculation
- Success criteria (what must be achieved)

## Technical Specifications

**Character Count**: 1,200 - 1,800 characters (including spaces)

- Minimum: 1,200 ensures sufficient context and immersion
- Maximum: 1,800 maintains single-page readability with accompanying illustration

**Paragraph Structure**: 3-4 paragraphs recommended

- Opening context: 1 paragraph
- Detailed situation: 1-2 paragraphs
- Challenge/question: 1 paragraph

**Numerical Precision**:

- Use 2-4 significant figures for realism
- Include decimals where appropriate to the context
- Vary precision levels (some round, some precise)

## Quality Differentiators (What Makes It Exceptional)

1. **Immersive vs. Instructional**: Reads like a professional briefing, not a textbook exercise
2. **Contextual Data**: Numbers emerge from story rather than being presented in isolation
3. **Professional Agency**: Solver has authority and responsibility, not just following instructions
4. **Authentic Complexity**: Reflects real-world messiness while remaining solvable
5. **Temporal Grounding**: Specific dates/eras create tangibility
6. **Human Stakes**: Solution matters for project completion, team coordination, resource allocation
7. **Visual Potential**: Scenario naturally suggests accompanying period-appropriate illustration
8. **Vocabulary Richness**: Domain-specific terms without unnecessary jargon

## What to AVOID

- Generic scenarios ("Two trains leave stations...")
- Artificially round numbers (100, 50, 25)
- Data presented in lists or tables within narrative
- Passive voice dominance
- Present tense for historical scenarios
- Asking "Show your work" or "Explain your reasoning" (keep focus on the answer)
- Mathematical terminology in the narrative (save for the challenge statement)

## Note on Adaptability

This specification applies across all mathematical topics—from basic arithmetic to calculus—by adjusting the professional role, scenario complexity, and technical vocabulary while maintaining the core narrative immersion principle.
