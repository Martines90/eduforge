## 📌 REMEMBER

**Physics formulas are not magic - they represent REAL physical laws governing REAL systems.**

Always:
1. **Start with the physical situation** (what's actually happening?)
2. **Identify the relevant physics principle** (which law applies?)
3. **Select the appropriate formula** (which equation captures this principle?)
4. **Provide complete data** (all variables with units)
5. **Expect physically meaningful result** (answer should make physical sense)

**The formula should EMERGE from the physics, not be forced onto an unrelated scenario.**
