You breathe half a liter. If pressure is half... Calculate: atmospheric pressure at 5895 m? Oxygen per breath here vs. sea level?"

**What This Tests:**
- Pressure decrease: P(h) = P₀ × (0.88)^(h/1000) (12% decrease per 1000 m)
- At 6000 m: P ≈ P₀ × 0.88⁶ ≈ 0.46 P₀ (about half sea level pressure)
- Partial pressure: P_O₂ = 0.21 × P_total
- Oxygen intake: Mass ∝ pressure (at same volume), so about half as much oxygen per breath
- Real altitude physiology: Why climbers need supplemental oxygen above 8000 m

**Physics Principles:**
- Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude
- Gas pressure determines density at constant temperature
- Partial pressure: Each gas component contributes proportionally
- Lower pressure → fewer molecules per breath → hypoxia

- Sequential startup: 5 plants at a time, each batch takes 4 hours, so ⌈28/5⌉ = 6 batches
- Total time: 6 batches × 4 hours ≈ 24 hours (if sequential)
- Current at full load: I = P/V = 55×10⁹ W ÷ 400,000 V = 137,500 A
- Real scenario: Blackouts do require careful sequential restart to avoid overcurrent

**Physics Principles:**
- Power = voltage × current (P = VI)
- Current = power / voltage
- Inrush current: Initial surge when equipment starts (much higher than steady-state)
- Grid stability: Must balance generation and demand carefully

## 🚫 AVOID THESE CLICHÉS

### Generic Abstract Physics:
- ❌ "A ball falls from a tower. Calculate its velocity."
- ❌ "A car travels at constant speed. Find the distance."
- ❌ "Two objects collide. Calculate the final velocities."
- ❌ "A spring oscillates with amplitude A. Find the period."

### Vague Scenarios:
- ❌ "An engineer needs to calculate the force."
- ❌ "Someone observes a wave. Find the frequency."
- ❌ "A machine uses power. Calculate energy consumption."

### Unrealistic Data:
- ❌ Perfectly frictionless surfaces (unless space environment)
- ❌ 100% energy conservation in real mechanical systems
- ❌ Impossibly precise numbers (3.14159265359... when 3.14 suffices)

## ✅ WHAT TO EMBRACE

### Specific Historical Events:
- ✅ Manhattan Project (July 15, 1945)
- ✅ Kursk submarine (August 12, 2000)
- ✅ Concorde crash (July 25, 2000)
- ✅ Tacoma Bridge collapse (November 7, 1940)
- ✅ Chernobyl disaster (April 26, 1986)

### Real Professional Contexts:
- ✅ Atomic physicist calculating bomb yield
- ✅ Naval engineer analyzing submarine survival
- ✅ Air traffic controller assessing crash dynamics
- ✅ Structural engineer preventing bridge collapse
- ✅ Power plant operator managing reactor cooling

### Life-Critical Stakes:
- ✅ "How much time before reactor melts through?"
- ✅ "How long can 23 people survive on this air?"
- ✅ "What force will stop the aircraft before runway end?"
- ✅ "Will the balloon lift us over the Berlin Wall?"

## 📌 KEY SUCCESS METRICS

A well-designed physics task should:

1. **Place student in authentic professional role** (not "you are studying physics...")
2. **Provide specific historical/contemporary context** (exact dates, locations, people, data)
3. **Connect physics to real-world consequences** (lives, disasters, engineering failures/successes)
4. **Require curriculum-aligned physics calculations** (mechanics, thermodynamics, E&M, etc.)
5. **Integrate interdisciplinary knowledge** (engineering, space, medicine, history)
6. **Use realistic physical systems and data** (not cartoon physics)
7. **Create intellectual engagement** ("THIS is how physicists use Newton's laws!")

## 📖 FINAL PRINCIPLE

**Every physics task should answer the implicit student question:**

> **"When will I ever use this in real life?"**

With authentic scenarios that show:
- **Manhattan Project**: E=mc² calculated actual bomb yield
- **Kursk**: Hydrostatic pressure determined rescue feasibility
- **Fukushima**: Heat capacity calculations predicted meltdown timing
- **Tacoma Bridge**: Resonance destroyed real bridge
- **Apollo 11**: Gravity and signal delay affected mission

**The goal**: Students see physics as a **powerful tool for understanding and predicting real physical phenomena**, not abstract formulas disconnected from reality.
