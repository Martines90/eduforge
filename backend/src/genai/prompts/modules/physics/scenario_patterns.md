## 🎯 SCENARIO SELECTION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Identify Physics Topic
- Mechanics → Forces, motion, energy, collisions
- Waves → Sound, light, oscillations
- Electricity → Circuits, magnetism, power
- Thermodynamics → Heat transfer, gas laws, phase changes
- Optics → Reflection, refraction, lenses
- Modern Physics → Nuclear, quantum, relativity

### Step 2: Find Natural Professional Application
Ask: "What professionals actually use [this physics] for [this type of problem]?"

### Step 3: Choose Fresh, Specific Context
- Avoid the first scenario that comes to mind (probably clichéd)
- Pick specific time, place, technology (not generic)
- Choose contemporary challenges when possible
- Focus on unexpected but real applications

### Step 4: Verify Realism
- Would this professional actually do this calculation?
- Are the numbers realistic for this context?
- Does this scenario naturally require this physics principle?
- Do the units and values make physical sense?

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Fresh > Familiar**
**Specific > Generic**
**Real Technology > Abstract Objects**
**Physical Meaning > Pure Numbers**

Choose unexpected contexts that show physics in ACTUAL modern applications.

**Every physics task should make students think:**
> "Oh! This is how engineers/physicists actually use [Newton's laws / energy conservation / wave physics / etc.] in the real world!"

**Not:**
> "Here's another abstract ball-on-ramp problem..."

**If the scenario could be from a 1950s textbook, it's TOO GENERIC. Make it contemporary and specific.**
