# ⚛️ PHYSICS - EVIDENCE & DATA REQUIREMENTS

## 🎯 WHAT STUDENTS NEED TO SOLVE PHYSICS PROBLEMS

**CRITICAL: Provide ALL physical quantities with UNITS.**

Physics problems require **COMPLETE NUMERICAL DATA WITH PROPER UNITS** so students can apply formulas and calculate physical quantities.

## 📊 MANDATORY DATA COMPONENTS

### 1. **All Numerical Values WITH UNITS**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "Initial velocity: 25 m/s"
- "Mass: 1,800 kg"
- "Force: 450 N"
- "Temperature: 87°C" (or 360 K if formula needs Kelvin)
- "Magnetic field strength: 0.5 T"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "Velocity: 25" → 25 what? m/s? km/h? mph?
- "Mass: 1800" → 1800 what? kg? grams? tons?
- "Some force" → Give the exact value!
- "Hot temperature" → How hot? Exact number with unit!

### 2. **Physical Constants (when needed)**

Always provide constants required for formulas:
- Gravitational acceleration: g = 9.8 m/s²  (or specify if on different planet)
- Speed of light: c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s
- Planck's constant: h = 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s
- Gas constant: R = 8.31 J/(mol·K)
- Boltzmann constant: k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K

### 3. **Material Properties (when relevant)**

Provide specific material properties:
- Density (kg/m³)
- Specific heat capacity (J/(kg·K))
- Thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))
- Electrical resistivity (Ω·m)
- Refractive index (dimensionless)

### 4. **System Configuration**

Describe the physical setup:
- Geometry (dimensions, angles, positions)
- Directions (horizontal, vertical, at angle θ)
- Initial conditions (at rest, moving at velocity v₀, etc.)
- Constraints (frictionless, adiabatic, etc.)

### 5. **What to Find**

Clearly state what quantity to calculate:
- "Calculate the final velocity"
- "Determine the force on the beam"
- "Find the time until impact"
- "Calculate the energy released"

## ✅ DATA PROVISION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every number has a UNIT specified
- [ ] All variables in relevant formulas are provided
- [ ] Physical constants included if needed
- [ ] Material properties specified if relevant
- [ ] System configuration described clearly
- [ ] Initial conditions stated
- [ ] What to calculate is unambiguous
- [ ] Values are realistic for the scenario
- [ ] Units are consistent (don't mix m and cm randomly)

## 🚫 COMMON DATA MISTAKES

❌ **Missing Units**: "The car travels at 60" → 60 km/h? m/s?

❌ **Wrong Unit System**: Using temperature in °C when formula needs Kelvin

❌ **Incomplete Information**: "Calculate the energy" but don't provide mass or velocity

❌ **Unrealistic Values**: Handgun bullet at 5000 m/s (realistic: 300-500 m/s)

❌ **No Constants**: Using E=hf without providing h = 6.63×10⁻³⁴ J·s

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Units are NOT optional in physics.**

Every physical quantity MUST have:
1. A numerical value
2. A unit of measurement

**If you write "velocity = 25" without saying "m/s", the problem is UNSOLVABLE.**

**Provide complete data. Include units. Always.**
