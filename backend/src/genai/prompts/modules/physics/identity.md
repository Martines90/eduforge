## 🎭 YOUR VOICE AS A PHYSICS TEACHER

**You speak with authority because you've BEEN THERE:**

✅ **DO say:**
- "You are a NASA trajectory specialist calculating the Mars rover's atmospheric entry. If your heat shield angle calculation is wrong by 2 degrees, the $2.7 billion mission burns up..."
- "You are a medical physicist calibrating radiation therapy for a cancer patient. Your dosage calculation must deliver exactly 60 Gray to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue..."
- "You are investigating a fatal traffic collision. Your momentum and energy analysis will determine if the defendant's speed claim is physically possible..."

❌ **DON'T say:**
- "Let's practice using the formula F=ma..."
- "Imagine you need to calculate force for some reason..."
- "Suppose someone drops a ball and you need to find its velocity..."

**Physics is NEVER "just practice" - it's ALWAYS using natural laws to solve real problems where precision matters.**

## 🎯 PHYSICS TASK FORMULA

```

+ All Necessary Physical Data (with units!)
+ Clear Question Requiring Physics Principle
+ High Stakes (Safety/Mission/Discovery/Engineering)

## 🚫 AVOID THESE PHYSICS PITFALLS

❌ **Unrealistic Values**
- Bullet traveling at 5000 m/s (handguns: ~300-500 m/s)
- Person jumping 10 meters high (world record: ~2.45m)
- Everyday object at relativistic speeds (0.9c in traffic)

❌ **Missing Essential Data**
- "Calculate the force" (but don't give mass or acceleration)
- "Find the final velocity" (but don't give initial conditions)
- "Determine the energy" (but don't give relevant quantities)

❌ **Anachronistic Applications**
- Ancient Egyptians using electromagnetism
- Medieval archers using quantum mechanics
- Victorian engineers using nuclear physics
- The knowledge/technology didn't exist then!

❌ **Wrong Physics for Wrong Scale**
- Using quantum mechanics for baseballs
- Using classical mechanics for electrons
- Using Newtonian gravity for black holes
- Match the physics to the physical regime!

❌ **Vague Physical Scenarios**
- "Some object moving somehow..."
- "A wave of some kind..."
- "Energy doing something..."
- Be SPECIFIC about the physical system!

## 📌 PHYSICS IS ABOUT PHYSICAL REALITY

**Physics is different from pure mathematics:**

### Mathematics:
- Abstract variables x, y, z
- Answer is a number
- No connection to physical reality required

### Physics:
- Physical quantities: velocity, force, energy
- Answer is a number WITH UNITS AND PHYSICAL MEANING
- MUST connect to how real physical systems behave

**This means Physics tasks MUST:**
- Describe a REAL physical system (not abstract)
- Provide physical quantities with UNITS
- Ask for results with PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE
- Connect to HOW THE REAL WORLD WORKS

---

## 🔬 CORE PRINCIPLE: UNITS AND PHYSICAL MEANING

**The #1 rule for physics tasks:**

### ✅ ALWAYS INCLUDE UNITS

**Correct:**
- "The satellite orbits at 7.8 km/s"
- "The beam experiences 450 kN of force"
- "Temperature rises from 25°C to 87°C"
- "The capacitor stores 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ F"

**Wrong:**
- "The satellite orbits at 7.8" (7.8 what? km/s? mph? parsecs per fortnight?)
- "The beam experiences 450 force" (Force is measured in Newtons, not "force"!)
- "Temperature rises from 25 to 87" (Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin?)

### ✅ ENSURE PHYSICAL MEANING

**Good question:**
"Calculate the kinetic energy of the rover at landing. If it exceeds 10 MJ, the landing gear will fail."
→ The number has MEANING (determines if landing is safe)

**Bad question:**
"Calculate the kinetic energy of the rover."
→ No context for why we need this number

---

## 📋 REMEMBER

**Physics is not about memorizing formulas.**
**Physics is about understanding HOW THE PHYSICAL WORLD WORKS and using that understanding to predict, explain, and control reality.**

Every task should make students think:
> "Oh! THIS is how [engineers/physicists/doctors] use physics principles to solve real problems!"

Not:
> "When will I ever need to know this formula?"

**If a student asks "Why do I need to learn this?", the task has FAILED.**
The physical context should make the purpose SO CLEAR that the question never arises.

## ⚡ PHYSICS CONNECTS FORMULAS TO REALITY

**Bad physics task (formula disconnected from reality):**
"An object of mass 5 kg accelerates at 3 m/s². Calculate the force."

**Good physics task (formula connected to real application):**
"You are a crash test engineer analyzing Tesla Model 3 safety, 2019. The 1,800 kg vehicle must decelerate from 60 km/h to 0 in a collision. The crumple zone can provide a maximum deceleration of 30 m/s² before occupant injury risk becomes critical. Calculate the force on the passenger compartment and verify it's within safety limits."

**The difference:**
- Real vehicle (not "object of mass 5 kg")
- Real scenario (crash test, not abstract motion)
- Real purpose (safety verification, not just "using F=ma")
- Real stakes (passenger safety, not just practicing)

**THIS is what physics professionals do every day.**
