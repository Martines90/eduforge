## 🎯 CORE HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES

History education develops **5 interconnected knowledge domains**:

### 1. 📅 LEXICAL KNOWLEDGE (Who, What, When, Where)
**What students must know:**
- **Dates & Chronology**: Specific dates, time intervals, phases of processes (year/decade/century precision)

- **Actors**: Countries, states, empires, rulers, military commanders, key figures, social movements
- **Locations**: Strategic cities, borders, trade routes, battle sites, affected regions
- **Political & Economic Processes**: Wars, alliances, economic policies, trade systems

**Real-world application**: "You need to negotiate with Emperor X. When did they rise to power? What major events shaped their worldview?"

### 2. 🔗 PROCESS & CAUSATION (Why Things Happened)
**What students must understand:**
- **Cause-Effect Relationships**: What triggered events? What were the consequences?

## 🎯 TASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR HISTORY

### ✅ EVERY HISTORY TASK MUST:

1. **Place student in AUTHENTIC ROLE** requiring historical knowledge
   - Diplomat, ruler, military commander, judge, curator, journalist, researcher
   - NOT "student studying history" - actual professional using history

2. **Create GENUINE NEED** for historical analysis
   - Critical decision with consequences
   - Problem that ONLY historical knowledge can solve
   - Real-world application (policy, law, strategy, authentication, etc.)

3. **Require SPECIFIC HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE**, not vague generalities
   - Exact dates, events, figures, documents
   - Precise geographic locations
   - Concrete examples from actual history

4. **Demand COMPARISON & ANALYSIS**, not just recall
   - Compare multiple historical examples
   - Identify patterns across cases
   - Evaluate outcomes of different historical approaches
   - Apply lessons to new situations

5. **Provide PRIMARY SOURCES or detailed historical evidence**
   - Actual excerpts from treaties, letters, speeches, laws
   - Archaeological evidence descriptions
   - Statistical data from the period
   - Multiple perspectives on the same event

6. **Show CONSEQUENCES** of historical knowledge application
   - What happens if you choose wrong alliance?
   - What if you misdate the artifact?
   - What if you ignore historical precedent?

## 🚫 AVOID THESE FAILURES

❌ **Generic "World War II question"** → ✅ "Analyzing the Yalta Conference transcripts, February 1945"
❌ **Vague "Renaissance art"** → ✅ "Authenticating a specific Caravaggio painting using period techniques"
❌ **Abstract "ancient Rome"** → ✅ "Consul's infrastructure decision, 312 BCE, comparing Via Appia vs. Aqua Appia"
❌ **"Study this battle"** → ✅ "You are at Waterloo. Wellington asks: What did Napoleon's tactics at Austerlitz suggest he'll do next?"
