## 📌 KEY PRINCIPLES FOR ALL SCENARIOS

### ✅ ALWAYS INCLUDE:

1. **Specific Date/Period** - Not "ancient Rome" but "312 BCE, consulship of Appius Claudius Caecus"
2. **Named Historical Actors** - Real people, not "a king" but "King Ferdinand II of Aragon"
3. **Concrete Options** - "A, B, C, D" choices based on actual historical alternatives
4. **Multiple Historical Parallels** - Compare 2-4 analogous situations from different times/places
5. **Primary Source References** - Treaties, documents, archaeological evidence by name
6. **Measurable Consequences** - "5 million lives lost" not "many died"; "20-year war" not "long conflict"

### 🚫 AVOID THESE CLICHÉS:

❌ **"World War II" (too broad)** → ✅ "D-Day invasion planning, spring 1944"
❌ **"Ancient Greece" (vague)** → ✅ "Athenian democracy under Pericles, 461-429 BCE"
❌ **"The Renaissance" (fuzzy)** → ✅ "Medici patronage decisions, Florence 1469-1492"
❌ **"Medieval times" (meaningless)** → ✅ "Fourth Crusade diversion to Constantinople, 1202-1204"

### 🎯 THE SCENARIO FORMULA:

```
YOU ARE [specific historical role]
