# 📜 HISTORY - EVIDENCE & SOURCE REQUIREMENTS

## 🎯 WHAT STUDENTS NEED

**CRITICAL: Provide PRIMARY SOURCE documents (excerpts).**

---

## 📊 MANDATORY COMPONENTS

### 1. **Primary Source Excerpts**

Provide ACTUAL historical documents (150-300 words minimum):
- Direct quotes from letters, speeches, declarations
- Newspaper excerpts from the period
- Government document excerpts
- Treaty text, law excerpts
- Diary/memoir passages

**Example:**
```
"Declaration of Independence excerpt (July 4, 1776):
'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness...'"
```

### 2. **Source Context**

For each source, provide:
- **Who** created it (author, position)
- **When** (specific date/year)
- **Where** (location, publication)
- **Why** (purpose, audience)
- **Type** (letter, speech, law, etc.)

### 3. **Multiple Perspectives**

When comparing/contrasting:
- At least 2-3 sources
- Different viewpoints on same event
- Sources from different stakeholders

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] PRIMARY sources provided (not summaries)

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **Summarizing instead of quoting**: Give the ACTUAL text!
❌ **No context**: Who wrote this? When? Why?
❌ **Too short**: 1-2 sentences isn't enough for analysis
❌ **No sources**: Can't analyze history without documents!
❌ **Modern paraphrasing**: Use original language!

## 📌 REMEMBER

**History requires PRIMARY SOURCE EVIDENCE:**
1. Actual historical documents (excerpted)
2. Sufficient length for analysis
3. Context for interpretation
4. Multiple sources when comparing

**If you summarize instead of quote, students have nothing to ANALYZE.**

**Provide actual historical texts. Always.**
