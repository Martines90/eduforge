# 🌍 GEOGRAPHY - EVIDENCE & DATA REQUIREMENTS

## 🎯 WHAT STUDENTS NEED

**CRITICAL: Provide SPATIAL DATA (maps, coordinates, statistics).**

---

## 📊 MANDATORY COMPONENTS

### 1. **Location Information**

Provide specific locations:
- Coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Place names (cities, regions, countries)
- Relative location descriptions
- Distance measurements

**Example:**
"Phoenix, Arizona (33.4°N, 112.1°W), elevation 1,117 ft"

### 2. **Spatial Data**

Quantitative geographic information:
- Population (density, growth rates)
- Distances (km, miles)
- Areas (km², acres)
- Elevation (meters, feet)
- Climate data (temperature, precipitation)

**Example:**
"Population: 1.7 million (city), 4.9 million (metro area)
Annual precipitation: 8 inches
Average summer temperature: 40°C (104°F)"

### 3. **Map Data**

Describe maps or provide visual information:
- Scale (1:10,000, etc.)
- Key features shown
- Distance measurements
- Spatial patterns visible

**Example:**
"Map shows population density per square km: Downtown core: 5,000/km², Suburbs: 800/km², Rural: 50/km²"

### 4. **Context**

Geographic situation:
- Physical features (mountains, rivers, coast)
- Human features (infrastructure, land use)
- Historical/economic context
- Regional characteristics

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Specific locations named
- [ ] Spatial data with units
- [ ] Coordinates or distances provided
- [ ] Maps described if referenced
- [ ] Geographic context given
- [ ] Values realistic for the location

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **Vague locations**: "A city" → Which city?
❌ **No spatial data**: Can't analyze patterns without numbers!
❌ **Missing units**: "Population 5 million in 100" → 100 what? km²?
❌ **No map data**: Mentioning a map without describing it
❌ **Unrealistic values**: Phoenix with 200 inches of rain? Wrong climate!

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Geography requires SPATIAL DATA:**
1. Specific locations (coordinates, names)
2. Quantitative data (population, distance, area)
3. Maps or descriptions of spatial patterns
4. Geographic context

**If you say "somewhere" instead of "Phoenix, Arizona", the analysis has no spatial specificity.**

**Provide complete spatial information. Always.**
