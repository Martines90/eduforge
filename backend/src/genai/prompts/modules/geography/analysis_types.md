# 🌍 GEOGRAPHY - ANALYSIS TYPES

## 🎯 GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS CATEGORIES

### PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
Climate, landforms, natural processes

**Topics**:
- Climate patterns and zones
- Weather systems
- Erosion, deposition, tectonics
- Water systems (rivers, oceans, aquifers)
- Ecosystems and biomes

**Real Applications**: Climate adaptation, disaster prediction, resource management

---

### HUMAN GEOGRAPHY
Population, culture, economics, urban systems

**Topics**:
- Population distribution and density
- Migration patterns
- Urbanization
- Cultural diffusion
- Economic development patterns

**Real Applications**: Urban planning, demographic policy, market analysis

---

### SPATIAL ANALYSIS
Location, distance, patterns, optimization

**Topics**:
- Site and situation analysis
- Distance decay
- Central place theory
- Spatial distribution patterns
- Optimal location problems

**Real Applications**: Facility location, transportation planning, market analysis

---

### ENVIRONMENTAL GEOGRAPHY
Human-environment interaction

**Topics**:
- Climate change impacts
- Resource depletion
- Pollution patterns
- Sustainability
- Environmental hazards

**Real Applications**: Conservation, climate policy, disaster management

---

### GIS & MAPPING
Spatial data visualization and analysis

**Topics**:
- Map interpretation
- Coordinate systems
- Scale and distance calculations
- Spatial data layers
- Remote sensing

**Real Applications**: Urban planning, environmental monitoring, logistics

## 📋 ANALYSIS STRUCTURE

Provide:
- SPATIAL DATA (maps, coordinates, statistics)
- Geographic context (specific locations)
- Analytical questions (why/how patterns exist)
- Real-world application

**Focus on SPATIAL REASONING, not memorization.**
