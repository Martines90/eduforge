**Nazi Gold Dissolution (Niels Bohr Lab, Copenhagen, 1940)**
- Max von Laue & James Franck hide Nobel Prize gold medals from Nazis
- Chemist George de Hevesy dissolves medals in aqua regia
- Jar sits on shelf throughout Nazi occupation (unnoticed)
- After war: Precipitate gold with reducing agent, re-cast medals
- Calculate: Gold concentration in dissolved solution (safety: store diluted)
- Chemistry heroism: Aqua regia saves priceless gold from theft

**Modern Gold Refining (Rand Refinery, South Africa, 2024)**
- Electronic waste (e-waste) gold recovery: Circuit boards, connectors
- Aqua regia digestion: Dissolves gold, silver, platinum-group metals
- Selective precipitation: Add FeSO₄ → Au precipitates, other metals stay dissolved
- Calculate: Gold yield from 1 ton e-waste (50-300 g Au, depending on source)
- Environmental: Aqua regia neutralization, precious metal recovery economics

**Forensic Gold Analysis (Jewelry Authentication Lab, 2024)**
- Test gold purity: Dissolve sample in aqua regia, ICP-MS analysis
- Distinguish: 24K (pure), 18K (75% Au), 14K (58.3% Au)
- Calculate: Concentration of Ag, Cu, Zn impurities in dissolved sample
- Fraud detection: Gold-plated tungsten (density match), counterfeit jewelry
- Hallmark verification: Chemical analysis confirms stated purity

## 🚫 AVOID THESE CLICHÉS

- ❌ Generic "mixing two chemicals in beakers"
- ❌ "School lab experiment"
- ❌ Abstract "Compound A + Compound B"
- ❌ Vague "someone needs to balance this equation"

**Instead: Be SPECIFIC**
- ✅ "Apollo 13 CO₂ scrubber calculation, April 1970"
- ✅ "Litvinenko Polonium-210 poisoning, London 2006"
- ✅ "Hindenburg hydrogen combustion, Lakehurst 1937"

## 🎯 SCENARIO SELECTION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Identify Chemistry Topic
- **Stoichiometry** → Apollo 13, gold extraction, mummification
- **Acids/Bases** → Cleopatra's pearl, aqua regia, acid rain
- **Nuclear Chemistry** → Litvinenko, Chernobyl, Fukushima
- **Thermochemistry** → Hindenburg, graphite fire, combustion
- **Toxicology** → Lead poisoning, arsenic, cyanide, mustard gas

### Step 2: Match to Archetype
Choose archetype that fits curriculum topic and creates authentic problem-solving context.

### Step 3: Add Specific Details
- **Real dates**: April 14, 1970 (not "1970s")
- **Real locations**: Lakehurst, New Jersey (not "USA")
- **Real people**: Frank Morris, Cleopatra, Napoleon
- **Real data**: 200,000 m³ H₂, 10 μg Po-210, pH 4.5

### Step 4: Verify Chemical Realism
- Real chemicals (not made-up)
- Realistic quantities and concentrations
- Actual reactions that occur
- Professional would do this calculation

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Historical > Generic**
**Real Chemistry > Abstract Problems**
**Life-Critical Situations > Academic Exercises**

Choose contexts showing chemistry solving ACTUAL life-or-death problems throughout history.

**Every chemistry task should make students think:**
> "This is how stoichiometry/acids/thermochemistry actually saved lives / solved historical mysteries / enabled exploration!"

**Not:**
> "Here's another abstract calculation..."

## 🎨 CREATIVITY PRINCIPLE

**These 17 archetypes are EXAMPLES, not limits.**

Use them as inspiration to create NEW scenarios following the same principles:
- ✅ Real historical/contemporary events
- ✅ Professional roles (engineer, toxicologist, conservator, etc.)
- ✅ Specific data (dates, locations, concentrations, masses)
- ✅ Life-critical or historically significant outcomes
- ✅ Authentic chemistry applications

**80/20 Rule**: 80% creative new scenarios inspired by archetypes, 20% direct archetype use.
