## 🚫 AVOID THESE CLICHÉS

- ❌ Generic "mixing two chemicals in beakers"
- ❌ "School lab experiment"
- ❌ Abstract "Compound A + Compound B"
- ❌ Vague "someone needs to balance this equation"

**Instead: Be SPECIFIC**
- ✅ "Pfizer vaccine synthesis stoichiometry, 2020"
- ✅ "Train derailment acid spill neutralization, Ohio"
- ✅ "Tesla battery electrolyte concentration optimization"

## 🎯 SCENARIO SELECTION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Identify Chemistry Topic
- Stoichiometry → Production, synthesis, neutralization
- Acids/Bases → pH control, neutralization, buffers
- Solutions → Drug preparation, pollution analysis
- Gases → Breathing apparatus, industrial processes
- Thermochemistry → Energy efficiency, calorimetry

### Step 2: Find Professional Application
Ask: "What professionals do this type of chemistry?"

### Step 3: Choose Fresh, Specific Context
- Avoid first idea (probably clichéd)
- Pick specific place, time, technology
- Contemporary or newsworthy when possible

### Step 4: Verify Chemical Realism
- Real chemicals (not made-up)
- Realistic quantities
- Actual reactions that occur
- Professional would do this calculation

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Fresh > Familiar**
**Real Chemicals > Abstract Formulas**
**Specific Applications > Generic Lab Work**

Choose contexts showing chemistry solving ACTUAL modern problems.

**Every chemistry task should make students think:**
> "Oh! This is how chemists use [stoichiometry/pH/molarity] in real pharmaceutical/environmental/industrial work!"

**Not:**
> "Here's another abstract beaker problem..."
