## 🚫 SCENARIO PATTERNS TO AVOID

### ❌ OVERUSED CONTEXTS (Use max 20%)

- Linguist studying grammar (that's linguistics, not literary analysis)

### ❌ CONTEXTS THAT DON'T REQUIRE ACTUAL TEXT ANALYSIS

- Personal journal reflection (no professional purpose)
- Social media book review (too superficial)
- Casual conversation about books

## 🎯 SCENARIO SELECTION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Identify Literary Analytical Skill
- Character analysis → Who needs to understand characters? (Directors, actors, screenwriters)
- Symbolism → Who interprets symbols? (Scholars, translators, curators)
- Theme → Who identifies themes? (Publishers, editors, curriculum designers)
- Technique → Who analyzes craft? (Translators, writing teachers, poets)
- Context → Who needs historical understanding? (Dramaturgs, museums, legal scholars)

### Step 2: Find Authentic Professional Application
Ask: "What professionals actually do this type of literary analysis for real decisions/creations?"

### Step 3: Choose Specific, High-Stakes Context
- Avoid generic "analyze this text"
- Choose specific professional moment with real consequences
- Make the stakes clear (money, truth, artistic success, justice, etc.)

### Step 4: Verify Text-Analysis Fit
- Would this professional actually read the text closely?
- Would they analyze the specific element you're asking about?
- Is the literary analysis the KEY to solving their problem?

Find contexts where:
- **Theater professionals** need to interpret character/drama for performance
- **Publishers/Editors** need to evaluate narrative/theme for acquisition

- **Scholars** need to reveal new interpretations for understanding
- **Curators** need to contextualize literary artifacts for audiences
- **Media creators** need to adapt literary works to new forms
- **Legal experts** need to interpret textual meaning for cases

**The scenario should make the NEED FOR TEXTUAL ANALYSIS obvious and urgent.**
