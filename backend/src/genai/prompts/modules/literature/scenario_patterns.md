## 📅 CHRONOLOGICAL STYLE ANALYSIS / DATING TEXTS

### Core Concept
Students arrange undated texts chronologically by analyzing stylistic evolution, thematic shifts, and historical language markers.

**Fresh Scenarios:**

**Neruda Periodization (Chile, 2012)**
- *Pablo Neruda Foundation* catalogs undated poems. Arrange 5 poems chronologically by style evolution. Periods: *Veinte poemas de amor* (1924, romantic accessibility), *Residencia en la tierra* (1935, surrealist anguish), *Canto general* (1950, political epic), *Odas elementales* (1954, democratic simplicity), *Memorial de Isla Negra* (1964, autobiographical reflection). Justify sequence using: imagery systems, political consciousness, formal complexity, tone.

**Golden Age Attribution (Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid, 2020)**
- Undated 17th-century sonnets. Attribute to period within Golden Age: Early (Garcilaso, 1500-1550), Mature (Góngora/Quevedo, 1580-1640), Late (Sor Juana, 1650-1700). Analyze: Petrarchan vs. conceptismo vs. culteranismo style, Renaissance vs. Baroque aesthetics, language evolution (Spanish consolidation), thematic shifts (pastoral → disillusionment → colonial complexity).

**Machado Brothers Differentiation (Seville, 2017)**
- Poems signed only "Machado" - *Antonio* or *Manuel*? Both wrote in early 1900s Spain. Distinguish by: Antonio (introspective, Castilian landscape, philosophical melancholy, Generation of '98), Manuel (theatrical, Andalusian folklore, sensory richness, modernismo).

## 🔎 DETECTIVE / LITERARY CODE DECRYPTION

**Fresh Scenarios:**

**Paris Murder Investigation (France, 2016)**
- Detective finds note in suspect's apartment: *"Meet where Baudelaire's albatross fell, when l'heure bleue fades."* Decode meeting location and time. Analyze: *L'Albatros* poem (Les Fleurs du mal, 1857) - what does albatross symbolize? Baudelaire's Paris haunts (specific locations?), *l'heure bleue* (twilight in French culture, but specific time?), symbolic vs. literal reading. Cross-reference Baudelaire biography, Paris 1850s topography.

**Art Theft Case (Madrid, 2018)**
- Stolen *Goya* painting. Ransom note quotes *Don Quixote*: *"En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme."* Interprets: Is "La Mancha" geographic clue? What does *no quiero acordarme* (don't want to remember) mean? Don Quixote's madness/reality theme relevant? Windmill symbolism? Analyze literary allusion's function: misdirection, genuine clue, or thief's intellectual vanity?

**Cold War Espionage Decryption (Berlin, 1975)**
- Intercepted letter between suspected agents uses *Borges* references: *"The garden of forking paths led to the Aleph in the Library."* Decode: Is "forking paths" = decision point (defection)? "Aleph" = meeting containing all points (central location)? "Library" = specific building (Staatsbibliothek?) or code name? Analyze Borges stories for symbolic meanings: infinite possibilities, labyrinths, hidden truths.

**Cartel Communication Analysis (DEA, Mexico City, 2020)**
- Drug cartel uses *magical realist* literary code. Message: *"The yellow butterflies returned to Macondo when the colonel counted 32 wars."* Decode: *Cien años de soledad* references (García Márquez). Butterflies = shipment? Macondo = location? Colonel = contact? 32 = quantity/date? Analyze: how magical realism's symbolic logic creates deniable code, cultural literacy as encryption barrier.

---

## 🖼️ ART AUCTION / EKPHRASTIC ANALYSIS

### Core Concept
Students analyze how visual art interprets literary texts (or vice versa), connecting textual imagery to artistic representation.

**Fresh Scenarios:**

**Pre-Raphaelite Shakespearean Art (Christie's, London, 2018)**
- Authenticate *John Everett Millais'* "Ophelia" (1851-52) as *Hamlet* Act IV Scene 7 interpretation. Analyze: How painting visualizes Gertrude's description of drowning. Compare textual imagery (willow, flowers, stream) to visual elements. Botanical accuracy: do painted flowers match Shakespeare's list (crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, long purples)? Symbolic meanings: flowers = innocence/madness? Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic fidelity to text vs. innovation?

**Spanish Civil War Poster Analysis (Museo Reina Sofía, Madrid, 2019)**
- Republican poster (1936-39) depicts woman with quote from *Antonio Machado*: *"Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar."* Analyze visual-textual dialogue. How does image interpret poem? What does "pathmaker" symbolize in war context? How does graphic design amplify/alter poetic meaning? Historical context: Machado's republican loyalty, mobilization propaganda, Civil War symbolism.

**Surrealist Poetry-Painting Pairs (MoMA, New York, 2020)**
- Exhibition: *Lorca-Dalí Collaborations* (1920s Spain). Analyze: *Dalí's* paintings illustrating *Lorca's* *Romancero gitano*. How does surrealist visual language translate poetic imagery? Does Dalí's eroticism match/diverge from Lorca's coded sexuality? Andalusian cultural symbols: gitanos, bulls, moon - textual vs. visual representation. Biographical tension: friendship/desire/betrayal.

**Contemporary Ekphrastic Poetry (Boston Museum, 2021)**
- Poet commissioned to write about *Frida Kahlo* painting (*The Two Fridas*, 1939). Evaluate 3 submitted poems. Which best achieves ekphrastic goals? Analyze: visual description accuracy, interpretation beyond description, cultural context inclusion (Kahlo's mestiza identity, dual heritage), emotional resonance, poetic technique (not just prose description in lines), respecting visual art's autonomy while creating independent poem.

## 📌 KEY PRINCIPLES FOR ALL SCENARIOS

### ✅ ALWAYS INCLUDE:

1. **Specific Date/Period** - Not "modern Spain" but "Barcelona, 2018" or "Franco's Spain, 1965"
2. **Named Literary Works** - Real texts, not "a novel" but "*Cien años de soledad*"
3. **Concrete Professional Contexts** - "Sotheby's auction appraiser" not "someone evaluating books"
4. **Real Geographic Locations** - "Granada" "Buenos Aires" "Moscow" with cultural specificity
5. **Actual Historical Moments** - "Soviet censorship 1968" "Franco regime 1965" "Boom literature 1960s"
6. **Measurable Outcomes** - "Select 2 of 4" "Rank by priority" "Authenticate or declare forgery"

### 🚫 AVOID THESE CLICHÉS:

❌ **"Discuss themes" (no stakes)** → ✅ "Netflix producer: rank 3 novels for adaptation, LA 2019"
❌ **"Study this text" (passive)** → ✅ "Therapist: select grief poems, London clinic 2018"

### 🎯 THE SCENARIO FORMULA:

```

✅ YES: Authentic literary task
❌ NO: Fake "homework" disguised as professional scenario

**Every literature scenario = Real professional literary analysis using real texts in real decisions.**

---

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Literary analysis is NOT:**
- Generic "What do you think about this poem?"
- Vague "Why is this author important?"
- Recall "Who wrote Don Quixote?"
- Opinion "Do you like this character?"

**Literary analysis IS:**
- Soviet censor (Moscow, 1968): Does this historical novel contain allegorical anti-state criticism? Analyze character parallels, symbolic events.
- Netflix producer (LA, 2019): Rank these 3 novels for adaptation feasibility. Analyze narrative structure, visual potential, character arcs.
- Poetry therapist (London, 2018): Select 2 of 4 poems for grief counseling. Analyze emotional tone, trauma-triggering imagery, healing themes.
- Auction appraiser (Sotheby's, 2017): Which 2 of these 5 books were banned under Franco? Analyze political dissent, regional nationalism, moral transgression.

**The scenario must make the NEED FOR CLOSE TEXTUAL ANALYSIS obvious, urgent, and professionally authentic.**
