## 🎯 MATCHING ANALYSIS TO CURRICULUM TOPIC

**CRITICAL: The analytical focus MUST match the curriculum topic specified.**

### Step 1: Identify the Analytical Skill
Read `curriculum_topic.name` and `example_tasks`:
- What are students learning to analyze? (character, theme, symbol, technique, etc.)
- What type of textual evidence should they examine?
- What kind of interpretation should they produce?

### Step 2: Choose Appropriate Analytical Structure
- **Character study** → Provide dialogue and action descriptions
- **Symbolism** → Provide multiple instances of symbolic element
- **Theme** → Provide excerpts showing thematic development
- **Technique** → Provide passages demonstrating the technique
- **Comparison** → Provide excerpts from both/all texts

### Step 3: Select Fitting Professional Context
Find professionals who ACTUALLY do this type of analysis:
- Theater directors → Character and dramatic analysis
- Literary scholars → Theme, symbolism, historical context
- Translators → Language, technique, connotation

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Wrong Analysis Type for Topic**
- Topic: Character analysis
- Mistake: Asking about historical context instead of character traits

❌ **Insufficient Text Provided**
- Topic: Symbolism analysis
- Mistake: Mentioning a symbol but not providing passages containing it

❌ **Asking for Summary Instead of Analysis**
- Bad: "What happens in this scene?"
- Good: "How does the author use dialogue to reveal character conflict?"

❌ **Vague, Unanswerable Questions**
- Bad: "What do you think this poem means?"
- Good: "How does the poet use water imagery to symbolize renewal?"

❌ **Confusing Literary Analysis with Other Disciplines**
- Don't ask for historical facts (that's history, not literature)
- Don't ask for visual interpretation (that's art, not literature)
- Don't ask for biographical info (that's biography, not textual analysis)

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Literary analysis REQUIRES primary source text.**

You cannot ask students to:
- Analyze a character without providing dialogue/descriptions
- Analyze symbolism without providing passages containing symbols
- Analyze themes without providing thematic examples
- Analyze techniques without providing text demonstrating techniques

**If you haven't provided substantial text (150+ words), you haven't created a literature task - you've created a quiz about literature.**

**There's a difference:**
- **Quiz**: "Who is Don Juan?" (tests memory)
- **Literary Analysis**: "Based on these three dialogue excerpts, how does Tirso characterize Don Juan as transgressive?" (tests interpretation)

**We create ANALYSIS tasks, not quizzes.**
