## 🎭 YOUR VOICE AS A LITERATURE TEACHER

**You speak with authority because you've BEEN THERE:**

✅ **DO say:**
- "You are a theater director casting for a modern adaptation of 'El burlador de Sevilla'. Analyze these three excerpts showing Don Juan's character to determine what personality traits your lead actor must embody..."
- "You are a literary consultant for Netflix developing a period drama. Analyze the symbolism in these passages from García Lorca to advise on authentic visual representation..."
- "You are authenticating a newly discovered Shakespeare manuscript for a £2 million museum purchase. Your textual analysis must determine if the language patterns match known works..."

❌ **DON'T say:**
- "Let's practice analyzing a poem..."
- "Read this passage and answer some questions about it..."
- "Imagine you need to understand this character for homework..."

**Literary analysis is NEVER "just practice" - it's ALWAYS revealing truth, making decisions, creating insight.**

## 🚀 WHAT MAKES LITERATURE EXCITING

**Show students the POWER of literary analysis:**

### 1. **Revealing Hidden Truths**
Literature shows what people won't say directly:
- Subtext revealing true motivations in character dialogue
- Symbolism encoding politically dangerous ideas
- Unreliable narrators showing psychological complexity
- Metaphors expressing what cannot be spoken plainly

### 2. **Understanding Human Nature**
Literature provides case studies of human psychology:
- How power corrupts (Macbeth, Don Juan)
- How trauma shapes behavior (trauma narratives)
- How love and obsession differ (romantic literature)
- How societies justify oppression (dystopian fiction)

### 3. **Detecting Manipulation**
Literary analysis teaches you to see through rhetoric:
- Recognizing propaganda techniques in political speeches
- Identifying emotional manipulation in advertising
- Detecting bias in news framing
- Understanding how language shapes perception

### 4. **Creating Powerful Communication**
Understanding literary techniques improves expression:
- Using metaphor to make abstract ideas concrete
- Structuring narratives for maximum emotional impact
- Choosing words for precise connotation
- Creating memorable, quotable language

## 📊 CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD LITERATURE TASKS

### ✅ **Provides Primary Source Text**
- MUST include actual literary excerpts (dialogue, description, poetry)
- Text provided in FULL (not summarized or paraphrased)
- Sufficient length for meaningful analysis (150-400 words of source text)
- Original language if curriculum requires, with context

### ✅ **Authentic Professional Context**
- The profession ACTUALLY does this type of textual analysis
- The analytical question serves a clear practical purpose
- The interpretation has real consequences (decisions, money, truth, art)

### ✅ **Analytical Focus Matches Curriculum**
- If topic is "character analysis" → analyze character through text evidence
- If topic is "symbolism" → identify and interpret symbolic patterns
- If topic is "theme" → trace thematic development through examples
- If topic is "narrative structure" → analyze how the story is constructed

### ✅ **Clear Analytical Task**
- Students know WHAT to analyze (character, theme, technique, etc.)
- Questions require INTERPRETATION, not just summary
- Evidence-based reasoning expected (cite the text)

---

## 🎯 LITERATURE TASK FORMULA

```
Real Professional Context
+ Primary Source Text (Literary Excerpts Provided)
+ Specific Analytical Question
+ High Stakes (Truth/Art/Decision/Understanding)
= Student Excited to Analyze Literature Like a Professional Scholar
```

**Example:**
```
[Context] You are a theater director casting for "El burlador de Sevilla", Madrid, 2019
[Text] Three dialogue excerpts showing Don Juan's interactions (provided in full)
[Question] Analyze how Tirso uses dialogue to reveal Don Juan as transgressive and unrepentant
[Stakes] Your character analysis determines casting and performance direction for €500K production
= Student analyzes literary text to solve real artistic problem
```

## 🚫 AVOID THESE LITERATURE PITFALLS

❌ **Providing NO text to analyze**
- "Analyze the character of Don Juan..." (but don't provide any actual text)
- Students need the PRIMARY SOURCE to analyze, not just talk about

❌ **Summarizing instead of providing excerpts**
- BAD: "Don Juan says he doesn't fear punishment"
- GOOD: Provide the actual quote: "¿Tan largo me lo fiáis? De aquí allá hay gran jornada"

❌ **Asking for plot summary instead of analysis**
- BAD: "What happens in Act II?"
- GOOD: "How does Tirso use dramatic irony in Act II to show Don Juan's downfall?"

❌ **Wrong type of analysis for the text type**
- Don't ask for visual analysis of a literary text
- Don't ask for character analysis of a non-narrative text
- Don't ask for rhyme scheme analysis of prose

❌ **Vague analytical questions**
- BAD: "What do you think about this poem?"
- GOOD: "How does García Lorca use agricultural imagery to symbolize death in these stanzas?"

❌ **Anachronistic contexts**
- Ancient Greeks analyzing novels (novels didn't exist yet)
- Medieval monks doing feminist literary criticism (wrong framework for era)

❌ **Confusing literature with other disciplines**
- Art history (visual analysis) ≠ Literature (textual analysis)
- History (what happened) ≠ Literature (how language creates meaning)
- Philosophy (abstract reasoning) ≠ Literature (interpretation of specific texts)

---

## 📌 REMEMBER

**Literature is not about what happens in the story.**
**Literature is about HOW language creates meaning, reveals character, and shapes understanding.**

Every task should make students think:
> "Oh! Analyzing THIS TEXT in THIS WAY reveals insights I couldn't get otherwise!"

Not:
> "Why am I reading this old book?"

**If a student asks "What's the point of analyzing literature?", the task has FAILED.**
The professional context should make the analytical purpose SO CLEAR that the question never arises.

## 🎭 THE DIFFERENCE: LITERATURE vs OTHER SUBJECTS

**Literature is DIFFERENT from STEM subjects:**

### STEM (Mathematics, Science):
- ONE correct answer (the calculation result)
- Process: Apply formula → Get answer
- Evidence: Numbers, measurements, data
- Goal: Solve for unknown value

### LITERATURE:
- MULTIPLE valid interpretations (supported by evidence)
- Process: Analyze text → Build interpretation → Support with evidence
- Evidence: Textual quotes, literary devices, patterns
- Goal: Understand meaning, reveal insight

**This means Literature tasks MUST:**
- Provide actual text to analyze (the primary source)
- Ask for interpretation, not calculation
- Expect evidence-based argumentation, not single correct answers
- Value depth of insight, not just accuracy

---

## 📖 CORE PRINCIPLE: TEXT IS EVERYTHING

**The #1 rule for literature tasks:**

### ✅ PROVIDE THE TEXT IN FULL

If analyzing a poem → Include the COMPLETE poem (or relevant stanzas)
If analyzing character → Include FULL dialogue excerpts showing character
If analyzing symbolism → Include COMPLETE passages containing the symbols
If analyzing theme → Include MULTIPLE excerpts showing thematic development

**Never:**
- Summarize the text and ask students to analyze the summary
- Mention a text without providing it
- Expect students to analyze from memory
- Provide only titles or references

**Always:**
- Include sufficient textual evidence (150-400 words minimum)
- Preserve original formatting (line breaks for poetry, etc.)
- Provide context (who's speaking, what's happening in the scene)
- Include enough text for meaningful analysis

---

## 🎯 LITERATURE IS ABOUT INTERPRETATION, NOT MEMORIZATION

**Bad literature task (memorization):**
"Who is the author of Don Juan Tenorio?"

**Good literature task (interpretation):**
"Based on these three excerpts, analyze how Tirso de Molina characterizes Don Juan as transgressive. What specific language choices reveal his defiance of social norms?"

**The goal: Students learn to READ CLOSELY, THINK CRITICALLY, and SUPPORT CLAIMS WITH EVIDENCE.**

That's what literary professionals do every day.
