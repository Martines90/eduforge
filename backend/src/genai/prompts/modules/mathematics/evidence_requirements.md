# 🔢 MATHEMATICS - EVIDENCE & DATA REQUIREMENTS

## 🎯 WHAT STUDENTS NEED TO SOLVE MATH PROBLEMS

**CRITICAL RULE: Provide ALL necessary information. No guessing. No assuming.**

Mathematics problems require **COMPLETE, SPECIFIC, NUMERICAL DATA** so students can calculate exact answers.

---

## 📊 MANDATORY DATA COMPONENTS

### 1. **All Numerical Values**

**Students need EXACT numbers, not ranges or estimates.**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "The bridge span is 385 meters"
- "The projectile's initial velocity is 42.5 m/s"
- "The compound has a molar mass of 180.16 g/mol"
- "The interest rate is 4.25% annually"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "The bridge is quite long" → How long? Give the number!
- "The projectile is moving fast" → How fast? Exact velocity needed!
- "Around 200 grams" → Is it 200? 195? 203? Be precise!
- "A few percent interest" → Exact percentage required for calculation!

---

### 2. **Units & Measurement Systems**

**Always specify units. Use the measurement system appropriate for the context.**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "The tank holds 500 liters of water"
- "The building is 127 meters tall"
- "The car travels at 28 m/s"
- "Temperature increased from 15°C to 47°C"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "The tank holds 500" → 500 what? Liters? Gallons? Cubic meters?
- "The building is tall" → No number at all!
- "The car is going 100" → 100 km/h? mph? m/s?

**Remember: Use {{METRIC_SYSTEM}} for measurements (specified in request).**

---

### 3. **Constraints & Conditions**

**Specify all limiting factors, rules, and conditions.**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "The cable's maximum safe load is 40% of tensile strength"
- "The reaction must stay below 100°C to prevent decomposition"
- "The budget cannot exceed $2.5 million"
- "Medication dose must be between 10-15 mg per kg of body weight"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "The cable has safety limits" → What limits? Be specific!
- "Don't overheat the reaction" → What's the maximum temperature?
- "Stay within budget" → What is the budget amount?
- "Dose depends on weight" → What's the formula/ratio?

---

### 4. **Geometric Information**

**For geometry problems, provide ALL necessary dimensions, angles, or positions.**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "Right triangle with legs 5.2 cm and 7.8 cm"
- "Cylinder: radius 12 cm, height 30 cm"
- "Angle of elevation: 32 degrees from horizontal"
- "Rectangle: length 45 m, width 28 m"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "A triangle with some sides given" → Give ALL relevant sides/angles!
- "A cylinder of certain size" → Provide radius AND height!
- "Looking up at an angle" → What angle in degrees?
- "A rectangular plot of land" → Dimensions required!

**If diagrams are mentioned, describe them precisely or state what measurements they show.**

---

### 5. **Initial Conditions & Starting Values**

**For problems involving change, provide starting states.**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "Initial velocity: 0 m/s (starts from rest)"
- "Account starts with $15,000 principal"
- "Population at year 0: 2,450,000 people"
- "Chemical concentration at t=0: 0.05 mol/L"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "The object starts moving" → From what velocity? 0? Something else?
- "Money in the account" → How much initially?
- "The population grows" → From what starting value?
- "The reaction begins" → What are initial concentrations?

---

### 6. **Rates & Changes**

**Specify how quantities change over time or per unit.**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "Interest rate: 3.8% compounded annually"
- "Acceleration: 9.8 m/s² downward"
- "Price increases by $12 per unit after the first 100 units"
- "Water flows in at 25 L/min, flows out at 18 L/min"

❌ **WRONG:**
- "Interest accumulates" → At what rate? Compounded how?
- "The object accelerates" → How much acceleration?
- "Bulk pricing available" → What's the price change formula?
- "Water enters and leaves the tank" → At what rates?

## 📊 EXAMPLE: COMPLETE DATA PROVISION

### ✅ GOOD EXAMPLE - Complete Data

**Scenario**: You are a structural engineer verifying the load capacity of a bridge cable for the Bay Bridge eastern span, San Francisco, 2002.

**Data Provided:**
- Cable diameter: 0.85 meters
- Total distributed load across main span: 240,000 kN
- Main span length: 385 meters
- Cable material: High-strength steel
- Steel tensile strength: 1,770 MPa
- Steel density: 7,850 kg/m³
- Safety requirement: Maximum stress must not exceed 40% of tensile strength

**Questions:**
1. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the cable in m²
2. Calculate the tensile stress in the cable in MPa
3. Verify if the stress is within the safe limit (yes/no with calculation)

**Why This Works:**
✅ Every number needed is provided
✅ Units are clear
✅ Safety criterion is explicit
✅ Questions can be answered with provided data
✅ No guessing or assuming required

### ❌ BAD EXAMPLE - Incomplete Data

**Scenario**: You are a structural engineer checking a bridge cable.

**Data Provided:**
- The cable is quite thick
- It supports a heavy load
- The bridge is in California
- Safety is important

**Questions:**
1. Calculate if the cable is strong enough
2. Determine the stress level

**Why This Fails:**
❌ No specific dimensions (cable diameter?)
❌ No load values (how much weight?)
❌ No material properties (tensile strength?)
❌ No safety criteria (what's the threshold?)
❌ Impossible to answer questions with given information
❌ Student would have to guess or make up numbers

## 🎯 SPECIAL CASES

### **When Diagrams Are Referenced**

If you mention a diagram, chart, or visual:
- Describe it precisely in text
- Provide all measurements shown in the diagram
- State what the diagram illustrates
- Give dimensions, angles, or data points visible in it

**Example:**
"The site plan shows a triangular plot of land with measurements labeled: north side = 47.2 meters, east side = 53.8 meters, and the angle between them = 78 degrees."

### **When Multiple Solutions Are Possible**

If the problem has multiple valid solutions:
- State this explicitly
- Provide criteria for selecting among solutions
- Ask students to identify ALL solutions or the most appropriate one

**Example:**
"The quadratic equation will yield two time values. Identify both solutions and explain which one is physically meaningful for this scenario (time cannot be negative)."

### **When Real-World Variation Exists**

If there's inherent uncertainty in real scenarios:
- Provide specific values to use for the calculation
- Note the real-world variation in context, but give precise values for the math

**Example:**
"The steel's tensile strength typically ranges from 1,650-1,850 MPa depending on manufacturing. For this analysis, use the specification value of 1,770 MPa."

## 📌 REMEMBER

**"How would a professional get this data?"**

Real professionals don't guess. They:
- Measure precisely
- Reference specifications
- Use known constants
- Follow regulations and standards

**Your task should provide data the same way:**
- Precise measurements
- Specific material properties
- Exact regulatory requirements
- Clear numerical constraints

**If a student asks "How am I supposed to know this number?", you've FAILED to provide necessary data.**

Every value needed for calculation MUST be explicitly provided in the scenario description.
