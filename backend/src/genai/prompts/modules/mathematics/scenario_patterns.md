## 🎯 SCENARIO SELECTION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Identify Mathematical Topic
- Algebra → Equations, unknowns, solving systems
- Geometry → Shapes, dimensions, spatial reasoning
- Statistics → Data, probability, trends
- Calculus → Rates of change, optimization, accumulation
- Trigonometry → Angles, triangles, periodic phenomena

### Step 2: Find Natural Professional Application
Ask: "What professionals actually use [this math] for [this type of problem]?"

### Step 3: Choose Fresh, Specific Context
- Avoid the first scenario that comes to mind (probably clichéd)
- Pick specific time, place, event (not generic)
- Choose unexpected professions or lesser-known events
- Focus on contemporary challenges when possible

### Step 4: Verify Authenticity
- Would this professional actually do this calculation?
- Are the numbers realistic for this context?
- Does this scenario naturally require this mathematical skill?

## 📌 REMEMBER

**FRESH beats FAMILIAR.**
**SPECIFIC beats GENERIC.**
**CONTEMPORARY beats HISTORICAL (most of the time).**

Your first idea is probably clichéd. Think of 3 options, then pick the most unexpected one that still authentically requires the mathematical skill being taught.
