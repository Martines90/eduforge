## 🎯 MATCHING PROBLEMS TO CURRICULUM TOPICS

**CRITICAL: The problem type MUST match the curriculum topic specified.**

### Step 1: Identify the Core Mathematical Skill
Read `curriculum_topic.name` and `example_tasks` to determine:
- What type of math is this? (algebra, geometry, statistics, etc.)
- What specific operation/skill? (solving equations, calculating area, finding probability, etc.)
- What level of complexity? (basic, intermediate, advanced)

### Step 2: Choose Appropriate Problem Structure
- **Solving equations** → Use algebra structure (unknowns, constraints, solve for variable)
- **Calculating area/volume** → Use geometry structure (shapes, dimensions, measurements)
- **Finding probability** → Use statistics structure (events, likelihood, data)
- **Optimization** → Use calculus/function structure (maximum/minimum, rates)

### Step 3: Select Realistic Professional Context
Find a profession that ACTUALLY uses this type of math:
- Don't force geometry into a statistics context
- Don't force calculus into a basic arithmetic context
- Match the mathematical complexity to the professional scenario

## 📌 REMEMBER

**The mathematical structure must serve the curriculum topic.**

Don't create a probability problem when the topic is geometry.
Don't create a calculus problem when the topic is basic algebra.
Don't create an estimation task when the topic requires exact calculation.

**Match the math to the curriculum. Match the curriculum to the profession. Make it all feel real.**
